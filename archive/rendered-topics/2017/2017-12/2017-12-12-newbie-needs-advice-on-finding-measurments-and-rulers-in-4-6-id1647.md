<p>The Annotations module contains rulers in Slicer4, and you can place them easily from the toolbar, see all information here<br>
<a href="https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/Nightly/Modules/Annotations" class="onebox" target="_blank">https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/Nightly/Modules/Annotations</a></p>
<p>A few more things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Please use 4.8 or newer, as 4.6.2 is more than a year old now, and the codebase has been considerably improved since then</li>
<li>There is work towards developing a new measurements module, so please consider this especially if you want to incorporate Annotations into any new module or script</li>
</ul>
