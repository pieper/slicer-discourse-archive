<p>Dear Slicer<br>
What are the minimum system requiremetns for Slicer 4.8.0 running WinXP Pro<br>
SP3 ?<br>
When I tried to run ir, it just showed up in TaskManager and sat there<br>
doing nothing.<br>
I tried looking through the forums and also tried your discbot and couldn’t<br>
find anything.</p>
<p>I just want to run your software because I have old CT images, and possibly<br>
new(taken Wed night) MRI imges that I NEED to see whats going on, because I<br>
am having (30yrs) problems of getting the doctors I see to actually<br>
acknowledge that I have bad back(HD L4-L5) and neck(arthritis), amongst a<br>
few other issues.</p>
<p>Thanks<br>
Rob Sherwood</p>

<p>Hi Rob,<br>
I think I am in safe territory saying that XP is not supported.<br>
It might work or might not.  You would definitely need 64 bit XP.<br>
Probably 2GB RAM.</p>
<p>If you can’t get Slicer to work, you might try ImageJ:<br>
<a href="https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/</a></p>
<p>Another option might be Slicer 3.6:<br>
<a href="https://www.slicer.org/slicer3-downloads/Release/win32/Slicer3-3.6.3-2011-03-04-win32.exe" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.slicer.org/slicer3-downloads/Release/win32/Slicer3-3.6.3-2011-03-04-win32.exe</a></p>
<p>Good luck!<br>

<p>Greg<br>
Thanks. Its that it is getting harder and harder to get a simple answer<br>
these days.<br>
I’ll give 3.6 a go, and i’ll get back to you.</p>
<p>The 4.8.0 exe Did show up in Task Manager, but it just sat there and did<br>
nothing. zero cpu usage. I though that the program might need a few minutes<br>
because it a fresh install and needs a bit of time to initialize, but ten<br>
mins later, still nothing.</p>
<p>thx<br>
