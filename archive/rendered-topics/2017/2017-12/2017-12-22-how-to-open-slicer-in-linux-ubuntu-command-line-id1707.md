<p>I downloaded Slicer-4.8.0-linux-amd64 on my linux ubuntu system, when I tried to open slicer, I first cd to Slicer-4.8.0-linux-amd64 folder, and typed ./Slicer in terminal. It said “error: Failed to obtain launcher executable name !”</p>
<p>What should I do? I also tried double-click the Slicer file, it still wouldn’t open.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
