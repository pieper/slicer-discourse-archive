<p>Hi,</p>
<p>For my master thesis in medicine I am using Slicer to analyse MRI images. In particular, I have to outline the same structure in every frame of the image, using the editor tool. Afterwards I can easily know the exact volume of the structure by quantification (label statistics). Now, it would also be interesting if I could measure the depth of the structure. To do so, I’d just have to draw a simple straight line. Then, I would need to know how long that line exactly is (depth).</p>
<p>I can not find a tool to draw straight lines in the editor section. The pencil function allows it, but when finishing your move with a right mouseclick, it always takes a circumcision.</p>
<p>So, I need a tool for just drawing straight lines, and afterwards be able to quantificate the line (knowing the exact length).</p>
<p>Does anyone know how to do this?</p>
<p>Thank you very much in advance.</p>

<p>Yes, you can make a ruler with the Annotations module:</p>
