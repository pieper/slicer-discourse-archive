<p>Hello,<br>
I notice the following presentation of system information preceding or introducing some questions, but found no place here that actually suggests to use it, or provides it as a template:</p>
<p>“Operating system: Windows 10 64bit<br>
Slicer version:4.9.0 2017-10-23<br>
Expected behavior: display the polydata independently<br>
Actual behavior: displayed one polydata in all of scenes.”</p>
<p>Is this a preferred question asking format?</p>

<p>I think posts that follow the described format are created by the application when you click on menu: Help / Report a bug / Post a new topic…</p>
<p>See <a href="https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/Nightly/Report_a_problem">this page</a> for a description of how to report errors.</p>

<p>Operating system: Windows 8.1 win-amd64 Intel Core i7<br>
Slicer version: 4.8.0  r26489<br>
Expected behavior: a template <strong>like this</strong> with first two maybe auto-filled out, and last two to be filled out by user<br>
Actual behavior: Help/Report a bug/ Post a new topic yields this: Problem report for Slicer 4.8.0 win-amd64: [please describe expected and actual behavior]</p>
<p>Hmm.  There was such a similarity in the format of system &amp; slicer info &amp; question/problem report from some posts that I thought there must be a template somewhere.</p>
<p>What I expected as a template was something like:<br>
Operating system:<br>
Slicer version:<br>
Expected behavior:<br>
Actual behavior:<br>
With maybe the first two filled in, with user filling in &amp; explaining the last two.</p>
<p>When I click on Help/Report a bug/ Post a new topic, what I get is:<br>
Problem report for Slicer 4.8.0 win-amd64: [please describe expected and actual behavior]</p>
<p>Which is just fine, I just wondered why/how there was such uniformity in some posts that followed the above blank format.</p>
<p>So it’s not a problem, I just wanted to make sure I was asking questions in a way that helps you all to get the info you need to easiilest answer them.  I think maybe my questions are too simple/naive to actually require the problem report format.</p>
<p>I think you all do a <strong>great</strong> job of developing and helping people use Slicer!</p>

<p>I’m not sure where the multi-line template comes from. I could not make Slicer reliably pre-populate posts with content that contains multiple lines, that’s why currently bug report posts are pre-populated with a single line of text.</p>
