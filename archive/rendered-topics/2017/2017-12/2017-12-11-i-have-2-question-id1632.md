<p>hi<br>
Is there a way to delete lines after creating them? I would think there is one but I cannot seem to find it.</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>Is there a way to make circles or essentially non-linear lines with the tool?</p>
<p>thx all</p>

<p>You can use Data module or Annotations module to delete rulers.</p>
<p>For drawing circles, you need to use some Python scripting - see this example: <a href="https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/Nightly/ScriptRepository#Manipulating_objects_in_the_slice_viewer">https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/Nightly/ScriptRepository#Manipulating_objects_in_the_slice_viewer</a></p>
