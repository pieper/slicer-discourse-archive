<p>Hallo,</p>
<p>I have a very simple question: how can fMRI results (in .nii format) be visualized with this software? Including a template of course.<br>
A tutorial would be much appreciated.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance.</p>

<p>Does drag-and-drop of volumes to the application window works? See <a href="https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/Nightly/Training#Slicer_Welcome_Tutorial">this page</a> for some basic visualization tutorials.</p>
