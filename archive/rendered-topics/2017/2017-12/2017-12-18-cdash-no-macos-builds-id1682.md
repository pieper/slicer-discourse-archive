<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>seems like there are some issues with the builds? There are no macOS builds listed on cdash. I just wanted to install an extension from Slicer ExtensionManager, but it told me that a dependency was not found.</p>

<p>Working on addressing the VMTK issue reported by <a class="mention" href="/u/lassoan">@lassoan</a> , I disabled it last night.</p>
<p>You could download the previous night package and install it by hand.</p>

<p>So tomorrow there will be a new nightly with all extensions?</p>

<p><a class="mention" href="/u/che85">@che85</a>  You should expect some delays for the extensions, see <a href="https://discourse.slicer.org/t/slicer-4-8-1-release-and-transition-to-qt5-and-vtk9/1551/8?u=jcfr">Slicer 4.8.1 release and transition to Qt5 and VTK9</a></p>
