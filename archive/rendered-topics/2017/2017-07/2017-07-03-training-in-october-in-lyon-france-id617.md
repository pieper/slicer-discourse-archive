<p>Hi Julien,</p>
<p>this is excellent. I would strongly recommend to use the new segment editor instead of the old editor. Completely rearchitected and contains a lot of interesting technology.</p>
<p>Also, the registration visualization in the transforms module is relatively recent and I am not sure if you have seen it.</p>
<p>Best</p>
<p>Ron</p>

<p>Hi Julien, will this also be recorded (for different time zones) or<br>
streamed (for compatible ones)?</p>
<p>Thanks.<br>
Tina</p>

<p>Hi Ron,</p>
<p>Yes, the new segment editor will be taught. I already taught that new editor and users loved it ! I think I’m up to date with the Transforms module.</p>
<p>The current “stable” version is typically used for training. And if a new feature is worth it (e.g. the new segmentation editor), the nightly may be a requisit.</p>
<p>Regards,<br>
Julien.</p>
