<p>Hi Slicers,</p>
<p>Apologize for the late notice but since most of the developers are attending the <a href="http://wiki.imaging.robarts.ca/index.php/Main_Page">26th Slicer Project week</a> at the Robarts Research Institute taking place in London (Ontario), the hangout of this week is cancelled.</p>

<p>It turns out that our first attempt at streaming tutorial using <a href="https://obsproject.com/">OBS Studio</a> was not successful, we will try to do better for the next session. If you have any information that would help us, do not hesitate to share them here. Merci</p>
