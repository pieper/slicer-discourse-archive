<p>I just built a release version but when I double click Slicer.exe (win7) I get the following error. Am I not running it correct? No error during building…</p>
<p>Debug Assertion Failed<br>
Program: …licer\SlicerBuild\Slicer-build\bin\Release\SlicerApp-real.exe<br>
File: f:\dd\vctools\crt\crtw32\misc\dbgdel.cpp<br>
