<p>Hello Slicer developers,</p>
<p>I have managed to develop a ScriptedLoadableModule, one module in Python language, resorting to Developer Tools - Extension Wizard. So far, I use the main window of Slicer to open it, selecting the Extension and the Module. What I pretend now is to open my module without open the Slicer’s main window. I am a quite new in Slicer software and according to my search, a Guidelet or a Slicelet is the best choice for that, right? Which of these would be better?<br>
I would like to know if it is possible to use the same code that I have developed in Loadable Scripted Module in order to implement the Guidelet/Slicelet.<br>
My intention is to create a desktop shortcut with my module that opens my module in Fullscreen mode without the Slicer’s main window.</p>
<p>Can anyone point me in the right direction?</p>
<p>Thank you so much,<br>
Roberto Barbosa</p>
