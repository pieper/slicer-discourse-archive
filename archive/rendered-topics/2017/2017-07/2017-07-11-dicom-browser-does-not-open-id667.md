<p>Operating system: Windows<br>
Slicer version: 4.7.0-2017-07-05<br>
Expected behavior: Open DICOM browser by clicking on DCM icon<br>
Actual behavior: 4.7 was working totally fine for me, suddenly it stopped responding. DICOM browser does not pop up when I click on DCM icon or “show DICOM browser” tab. Is there anyway to reboot slicer? should I re-install the nightly version?<br>
Thanks<br>
Faraz</p>

<p>Deleting the settings folder might help:</p>
