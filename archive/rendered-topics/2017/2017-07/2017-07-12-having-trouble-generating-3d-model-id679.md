<p>Thank you all for this great software and great forum<br>
I am having trouble generating STL model from CT scan.<br>
Once I upload the CT scan, I go to volume rendering and choose Bone as a preset tool. However, it worked only once with me after that I can’t do it again. I can not have a 3D model to crop from a 3D model</p>
<p>Could anyone please help me with this?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

    Hello, I am a new user on 3D slicer. 
I was using the display preset feature under volume rendering, and I was wondering if there is a way to save what I was viewing as an .stl or 3D printable file. 
For example, I was viewing a sample MRI using the CT-cardiac3 preset display. 
When I tried to save that specific 3D preset displayed sample in a .stl file, the option was unavailable. 
I was only able to see .vp (volume property), .txt formats. 
Is there a way to accomplish what I desire in 3D slic…
