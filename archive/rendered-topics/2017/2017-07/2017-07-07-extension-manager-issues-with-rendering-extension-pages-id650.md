<p>as a followup, the extension was not installed even though as could be seen from the video it was downloaded and presumably installed.</p>

<p>The problem is intermittent and not always reproducible …</p>

<p>I sometimes (very rarely) see similar issues. Usually on bad internet connections. Can you reproduce it fairly often? Is there any useful info in the log? Is download stable through a regular web browser?</p>

<p><a class="mention" href="/u/lassoan">@lassoan</a> I did not experience any connection issues at the time I observed this problem, I was at my desk at work<br>
at that time. I did not check the log or tried through a regular web browser. If I remember, I will do this next time I experience this issue.</p>
