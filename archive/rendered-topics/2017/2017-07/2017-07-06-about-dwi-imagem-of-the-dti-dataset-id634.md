<p>Good morning,</p>
<p>I would like to request, if possible, the characteristics of the DWI sequence used in the DTI dataset (echo time, repetition time, etc), so that I can perform a similar sequence in the 7T machine I am using and test your DTI pipeline (the sequences I have been doing in the 7T somehow do not work in the pipeline).<br>
Thanks for the help.</p>

<p>I don’t have the parameters on hand right now, but anything resembling the Siemens product sequence (assuming you are on a Connectom…) should be fine.</p>

<p>Could you please provide more information about what the issue is? Also any anonymous test datasets could be very helpful.</p>
