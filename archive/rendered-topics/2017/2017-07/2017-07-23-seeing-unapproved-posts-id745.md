<p>I couldn’t seem to find a way to retrieve a topic that I just created because I pressed a button by accident and it created the topic before I was done writing it up.</p>
<p>Could there be a way to let users see their own unapproved posts so that they can modify them?</p>

<p>I don’t see any unapproved posts. One option is to post again. If I see two very similar posts then I usually approve there more recent one and discard the other. After a few reading and writing A few posts your user is automatically promoted and your posts appear immediately, without requiring approval.</p>

<p>I rejected an incomplete post about sequences earlier (and approved the longer one).</p>
<p>I don’t think there is any option to allow editing queued posts.</p>

<p>Thanks for that. I was suggesting to allow editing of queued posts, so that the user does not have to type everything all over again</p>
