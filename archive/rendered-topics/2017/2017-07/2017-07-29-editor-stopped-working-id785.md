<p>What Slicer version are you using?<br>
What did you do right before the editor stopped working?<br>
What do you mean that it stopped working (what did you do exactly, what did you expect to happen, what happened instead)?<br>
Do you use <code>Editor</code> module or <code>Segment editor</code> module?</p>

<p>I am using 4.7.0<br>
I was editing a CT scan<br>
None of the tools were working. I was erasing something and then it stopped<br>
all of a sudden.<br>
I had to delete the whole file and start over for it to start working. I<br>
finally got it though</p>
