<p>I am working on a proposal and needed a brief history of Slicer (or even when Slicer came into existence as a product distinct from its components). I am surprised this information is not readily available in the about link (the announcement for v1.3 is dated from 2002, which was the oldest link I could find). Perhaps one of the old-timers can provide a brief history or milestones with dates.</p>

<p>Dr. Hata did a brief history presentation at a recent Slicer Project Week in London, ON. I’ll check with him to see if he can share his slides.</p>

<p>These papers and the book chapter also give some background:</p>
