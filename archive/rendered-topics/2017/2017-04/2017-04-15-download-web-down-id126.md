<p>Until the download page is fixed, you can download packages from these alternative sources:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://slicer.kitware.com/midas3/slicerpackages/view/advanced">package repository</a></li>
<li><a href="http://slicer.cdash.org/index.php?project=Slicer4">dashboard</a> (click on the little yellow box icon  <img src="https://us1.discourse-cdn.com/flex002/uploads/slicer/original/3X/b/2/b20fc56836071f4125e984b00617d9d8f2f36157.png" alt="image" data-base62-sha1="ppcMjhXkGsI9zcrkg6fA2dUTkGP" width="16" height="16"> in the “Build name” column)</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://na-mic.org">na-mic.org</a> domain appears to be down as well. I will report to the folks who are maintaining these resources.</p>

<p>Should we define a tag for network infrastructure issues and ask admins to subscribe to that? That way they would be automatically notified about problems that needs their attention.</p>

<p>They acknowledged the issue, but it sounds like it won’t be fixed today. The problem with partners hosted resources is that there multiple people/units involved, and the troubleshooting process is unclear. At this point, the response I received from Greg is that “a trouble ticket should be opened with Partners helpdesk”. I am traveling and won’t be able to do that anytime soon.</p>

<p>The issue has been resolved. Namic and download sites are up again.</p>

<p>We have  a web server issue that we are working on diagnosing.</p>
<p>We have migrated <a href="http://slicer.org" rel="nofollow noopener">slicer.org</a> and <a href="http://na-mic.org" rel="nofollow noopener">na-mic.org</a> away from this server, and that’s why they are still up.</p>
<p><a href="http://download.slicer.org" rel="nofollow noopener">download.slicer.org</a> remains and will remain down until at least tomorrow morning when we can get someone to access it physically.</p>
<p>We apologize for the inconvenience.</p>

<p><a class="mention" href="/u/mhalle">@mhalle</a> Do you have an estimate how long it is going to take to restore the download page?</p>
<p>If it takes several more hours then we may update <a href="http://slicer.org">slicer.org</a> with a note that we are working on the download site issue problem and we may even add today’s download links there.</p>

<p><a class="mention" href="/u/lassoan">@lassoan</a> thanks for mentioning this! Indeed, Slicer packages can still be downloaded from the dashboard here, independently from <a href="http://download.slicer.org">download.slicer.org</a>: <a href="http://slicer.cdash.org/index.php?project=Slicer4&amp;display=project" class="inline-onebox">CDash</a></p>
