<p>The OAuth endpoint is under a Google API project called <code>slicer-discourse</code> (<a href="https://console.developers.google.com/apis/dashboard?project=slicer-discourse" rel="nofollow noopener">current link</a>).</p>
<p>I added Jc, Steve, and Andrey as owners as well, so somebody should always be able to access (couldn’t find gmail account for <a class="mention" href="/u/lassoan">@lassoan</a> but can add you too).</p>
<p>Shouldn’t need much interaction. In the worst case you could just create a new API project and enter the updated key/token. Users might have to re-allow the authentication, but should not lose any account association.</p>
