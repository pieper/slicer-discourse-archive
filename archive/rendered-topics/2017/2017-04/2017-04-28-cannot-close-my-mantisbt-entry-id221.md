<p>Hi, I want to close my issue <a href="https://www.na-mic.org/Bug/view.php?id=4369" rel="nofollow noopener">0004369: “Report bugs” dialog’s link to the slicer-users mailing list is broken</a>, but I don’t have the permissions to change the Status field from ‘new’. So I just set the Resolution field. Is it fine like that?</p>
