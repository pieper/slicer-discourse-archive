<p>Reasons for my vote:</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>I like the social features and integration with other sites (github especially)</li>
<li>It’s modern and has lots of useful features</li>
</ul>
<p>Slightly less than pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>I didn’t find it particularly obvious what to do when I first got to the page</li>
<li>Finding documentation (like how to make a poll) was difficult (lots of googling before I found a blog post with some examples)</li>
</ul>
<p>No real cons!</p>

<p>I added <code>Click "New Topic" to get started!</code> to the first sentence in the welcome banner to maybe help.</p>

<p>What do you think about making the Category list the default view (<a href="https://discourse.slicer.org/categories">https://discourse.slicer.org/categories</a>)? I find it easier to get started from a list of categories than from a flat list of latest posts.</p>

<p>Personally, I like the list of latest topic, gives you quick view instead of having to check each category.</p>

<p>I think Unread is the one I will end up using most.  I don’t know how much traffic there is going to be, but I suspect I’ll try to read it all.</p>

<p>On the second look, I agree with Andras suggestion. I was looking at it from the phone, and it looks a bit different, but on the desktop it looks better.</p>

<p>It seems other many other sites end up using category view as homepage, too.</p>
<p>On Mozilla’s discourse site they analyzed site stats and it turned out to be a more welcoming homepage (<a href="https://discourse.mozilla-community.org/t/categories-as-homepage/280/24">https://discourse.mozilla-community.org/t/categories-as-homepage/280/24</a>). It’s nice that with these tools you can make decisions based on data, not just on based on beliefs.</p>
<p>I’ve moved the category view to be the default view. If we want to change this, the setting is available here:<br>
<a href="https://discourse.slicer.org/admin/site_settings/category/all_results?filter=top_menu" class="onebox" target="_blank">https://discourse.slicer.org/admin/site_settings/category/all_results?filter=top_menu</a></p>

<p>I don’t have a strong preference, but personally I always click Latest.</p>

## Post #10 by @lassoan (2017-04-12 20:35 UTC)

<p>Latest is shown, too: left column is Categories, right column is Latest.</p>

<p>Not on phone. Not a big deal though.</p>
