<p><a class="mention" href="/u/aylward">@aylward</a>  Thanks for trying things.</p>
<p>To everyone: to put things in context, to allow Stephen to first post without an account. I updated the setting associated with <code>slicer+support@discoursemail.com</code> to allow anonymous settings:</p>

<p>Why this is needed? The user needs to come to the forum webpage for answers anyway.<br>
Also, I would not like to spend time with answering a question to a user that did not even take the time to sign up.</p>

<p>This is a test done with Ron to emulate the experience/workflow of someone<br>
first downloading Slicer and having a question.</p>

<p>I see. For that we should add a link that posts a new topic in the Support category:</p>
<p><a href="https://discourse.slicer.org/new-topic?category=support">https://discourse.slicer.org/new-topic?category=support </a></p>
<p>We can even pre-populate the topic name or body:<br>
[ <a href="https://discourse.slicer.org/new-topic?title=topic%20title&amp;body=topic%20body&amp;category=support">https://discourse.slicer.org/new-topic?title=topic%20title&amp;body=topic%20body&amp;category=support</a>]</p>
<p>with some more text:<br>
<a href="https://discourse.slicer.org/new-topic?body=Operating%20system:%0ASlicer%20version:%0AExpected%20behavior:%0AActual%20behavior:&amp;category=support"> https://discourse.slicer.org/new-topic?body=Operating%20system:%0ASlicer%20version:%0AExpected%20behavior:%0AActual%20behavior:&amp;category=support</a></p>

<p>So, to clarify, what you want is to manage subscription purely by email?</p>
<p>With the setting Jc changed, it is possible to post a new topic, but I don’t think it is possible to become a full subscriber without logging in once. If I am reading the description “What are staged users” on <a href="https://meta.discourse.org/t/setup-incoming-emails-e-mail/42026">this post</a> correctly, then the user will not get any other messages in the category (or Announcements) until they log in once and create a full account.</p>
<p>Just to check, <a class="mention" href="/u/aylward">@aylward</a> did you receive any email notice for this thread in Support?</p>

    Three semi-automatic segmentation effects have added to the Segment editor. They are available in the latest nightly build, by installing the new SegmentEditorExtraEffects extension:

They are all semi-automatic methods, which grow segmentation from seeds/points defined by the user. 
Watershed: similar to grow from seeds. Advantage: smoothness of the segments can be enforced. Disadvantage: much slower.
