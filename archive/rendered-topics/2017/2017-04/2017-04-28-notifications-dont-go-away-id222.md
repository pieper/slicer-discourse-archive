<p>In my short time here, I already got a lot of Discourse notifications:<br>

<p>According to <a href="https://meta.discourse.org/t/feature-request-please-add-dismiss-all-notifcations-link-to-user-activty-widget-box/61694/2" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">this meta.discourse post</a>,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Notifications go away when you interact with the cause of the notification, either by clicking the notification or navigating manually to the cause […]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, my notifications don’t go away like that, and in addition to that, the <code>Dismiss All</code> button is disabled on my page <a href="https://discourse.slicer.org/u/jondo/notifications">https://discourse.slicer.org/u/jondo/notifications</a>.</p>
<p>Does this work for you?</p>

<p>I don’t think there is any way to clear the list. Viewing a thread or clicking “Dismiss All” will get rid of the unread count above your user icon (number inside a blue circle, e.g.: <img src="https://us1.discourse-cdn.com/flex002/uploads/slicer/original/1X/73bd1291f46d1f096a6fce3548e8b1b2f70d2d5f.jpg" width="42" height="52">) and the light blue highlighting of each unread row in the activity list.</p>

<p>Ah, I expected the items in the small popup list to be removed, like the Discourse founder had implemented on StackOverflow. I have <a href="https://meta.discourse.org/t/how-to-delete-clear-notifications/37783/13?u=jondo" rel="nofollow noopener">told the Discourse people</a> now.</p>
