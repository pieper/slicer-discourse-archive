<p>Currently the <code>feature</code> tag indicates that we write about a new feature. This allows people to get notified if they are interested (you can set up alerts for topics with certain tags).<br>
I think we add features frequently enough that the announcements category might get too much traffic, but I’m not sure.</p>

<p>Depends on what kind of news the community considers an Announcement. If we consider the Announcements wiki page, about which I had the feeling was considered underused (we were asked a few times to add this and that), then I think this qualifies (looking at improved startup time, DCMTK updata, etc.).<br>

<p>FWIW, 1-2 posts/wk in Announcements feels reasonable to me. I don’t think we’re going to average much more than that in the foreseeable future. If it is a problem we could collect them with the <code>feature</code> tag and batch weekly or so.</p>
