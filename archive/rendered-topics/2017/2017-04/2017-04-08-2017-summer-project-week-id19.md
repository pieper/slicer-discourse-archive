<p>“The 25th Project week will be held in Catanzaro Lido (Calabria, Italy) on June 26-30, 2017. This is the first time in Italy for the Slicer Community, and the event is organized in cooperation with ImagEngLab. Catanzaro Lido is a city on the Ionian Sea, in the middle of Squillace Gulf where, according to the ancient legend, Odysseus started his journey back to Ithaca. Of course bring your swimsuit…the conference room and the hotel are 20 meters far away from the beach!”</p>
