<p>I was just in the middle of reading a topic, when Discourse decided to log me out (some timeout) and bring me to the start page <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/unamused.png?v=5" title=":unamused:" class="emoji" alt=":unamused:"></p>
<p>If there is a corresponding timeout setting, can you please change it?</p>

<p>Sorry, I think that was my fault while investigating your other post. Shouldn’t happen again.</p>
