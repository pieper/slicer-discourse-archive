<p>This is where you should ask questions about any issue you are having with 3D Slicer.</p>
<p>The “Usage” category is for discussion of 3D Slicer usage (equivalent to the slicer-users mailing list). This is the default location for new posts, send your questions this way!</p>
<p>(Discourse allows topics to be easily split/moved/merged as needed, so please post away! mods will tidy-up if needed)</p>
