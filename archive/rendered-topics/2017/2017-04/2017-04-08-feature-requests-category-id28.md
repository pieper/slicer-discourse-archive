<p>I suggest we add a separate category “Feature requests”. This can be used to prioritize development, collect votes on features, and discuss implementation approaches.</p>

<p>Good idea to mark feature requests, especially if we can vote for them. Can we vote?<br>
I think it’s also possible to define tags for each topic, so that’s an option, too (to keep the number of categories manageable).</p>
<p>It would be also useful to be able to mark posts about implemented new features (completed feature requests).</p>

<p>We can “like”, which essentially is the same as voting. Unfortunately, we cannot sort posts by likes (or can we? maybe it’s a configuration option?).</p>

<p>Yes, that’s an option too, the difference is tags can be assigned by the user, and don’t need to be assigned. They could be assigned as part of triaging a topic by experienced users, but the problem is the topic can be broader than feature request. Having a dedicated category would 1) remind users that they are welcomed to submit feature requests; 2) keep topics focused on feature requests. See example of topic organization here: <a href="http://forum.paperpile.com/c/feature-requests">http://forum.paperpile.com/c/feature-requests</a></p>

<p>We could add prefix [RESOLVED] in the title of the topic to address this?</p>

<p>It’s possible to “close” topics. Maybe that could be usable, too.<br>
Not all new features are requested through the forum. Maybe a more generic name such as “New features” would cover both?</p>
<p>I guess we need to check out a couple of forums and learn from them.</p>

<p>We can also create subcategories, just for testing it I’ve added Features / Feature requests - see <a href="https://discourse.slicer.org/categories">https://discourse.slicer.org/categories</a></p>
