<p>I cannot put any subcategories under “Support” category (I would add Feature requests, maybe other subcategories, too) and cannot edit the description either. As is, it is not really usable.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/ihnorton">@ihnorton</a>, do you know why this category is special? Should we keep it?</p>

<p>It was derived from the special catch-all default category (“Uncategorized”). I renamed it back to Uncategorized, then disabled that and created a new regular Support category (that can be a parent category if needed).</p>
