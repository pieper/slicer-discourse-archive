<p>I cannot find an up-to-date Slicer API documentation.<br>
Link to Doxygen documentation on <a href="https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/Nightly/Developers">https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/Nightly/Developers</a> page is outdated:<br>
<a href="https://www.slicer.org/doc/html/classes.html">https://www.slicer.org/doc/html/classes.html</a></p>

<p>I thought <a class="mention" href="/u/jcfr">@jcfr</a> configured it in this repository: <a href="https://github.com/Slicer/slicer-apidocs-builder">https://github.com/Slicer/slicer-apidocs-builder</a></p>
<p>But I get 404 when trying to access <a href="http://apidocs.slicer.org/">http://apidocs.slicer.org/</a></p>

<p>Mike still needs to set the redirect from <a href="https://www.slicer.org/doc/html/">https://www.slicer.org/doc/html/</a> to <a href="http://apidocs.slicer.org/master/">http://apidocs.slicer.org/master/</a></p>
<p>Since there was no top level page on  <a href="http://apidocs.slicer.org">http://apidocs.slicer.org</a> it returned a 404. I just added one.<br>
See <a href="http://apidocs.slicer.org/">http://apidocs.slicer.org/</a></p>

<p>It would be also useful to remove the old documentation to reduce chance of accidentally finding the outdated version (for example, by google search).</p>

<p>With the redirect put in place by Mike and Greg, link found on Google will redirect to the latest version of the documentation.</p>
