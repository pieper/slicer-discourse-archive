<p>I just bumped into the Help wiki page that still pointed the readers to the mailing list. I edited it quickly so that Discourse is the main way of communication. Please review<br>

<p>Thanks Csaba - yes, it’s great to update these - we been talking about giving a bit more time for transition but it seems momentum is gaining here on the forum.</p>

<p>Makes sense. My direct motivation was that I needed to approve a kitware source article I wrote, and in that the mailing list was specified as the way to contact us (the link pointing to this help page), and I didn’t want to promote the method we’re trying to move away from.</p>

<p>I updated this page again:</p>
<ul>
<li>removed confusingly-worded old text (read as though the mailing list was still accepting questions)</li>
<li>removed the link to mailing list subscription. Now only linking archives.</li>
<li>listed mailing list at bottom of page, and as “Discontinued”</li>
</ul>

<p>The wiki Contact page still refers to the mailing lists, at the bottom.</p>
