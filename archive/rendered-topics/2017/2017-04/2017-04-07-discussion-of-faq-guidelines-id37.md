<p>This is another good place to remind people to respect patient confidentiality and never post or link to any patient identifiable content (such as screen captures with patient names visible or dicom files that contain patient ids).</p>

<p>I’ve just realized that it’s the Staff category, which is not visible to users. Probably we should add some guidelines post in a public category.</p>

<p>I moved it to Forum Support so it is globally visible, and moved this thread to a new topic in Staff.</p>
