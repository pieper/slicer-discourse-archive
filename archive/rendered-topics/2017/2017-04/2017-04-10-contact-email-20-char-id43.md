<p>The last item on my list was a contact email, for this page:</p>
<p><a href="https://discourse.slicer.org/about">https://discourse.slicer.org/about</a></p>
<p>It is intended for “urgent” issues. The only thing like that I can think of are spambots or garbage/ad posters. Not sure if necessary, or maybe we can list the special google group for slicerbot if/when that is set up (or an account that forwards to that group).</p>

<p>I saw that <a class="mention" href="/u/ihnorton">@ihnorton</a>’s BWH email was still being used for this, but it’s no longer active so I changed to my isomics account.  If anyone else wants to be the contact feel free to update (or we could create a mail list if needed).</p>
