Will we be able to create subforums for the SlicerVerse?</p>

Categories seem to be there most suitable way of creating separate discussion spaces for subcommunities.</p>

<p>I created a Communities category with “SlicerCMF” underneath it, as a demo/test:</p>
<p><a href="https://discourse.slicer.org/c/communities/slicercmf" class="onebox" target="_blank">https://discourse.slicer.org/c/communities/slicercmf</a></p>
<p>Other than a handful of existing communities who have/had other forums, I think we should be judicious with category creation, especially at the top level (don’t want it to be overwhelming/confusing). We can use tags freely and observe if any eventually need separate categories.</p>
<p>Also: the sub-categories could be customized with images to make it feel more welcoming…</p>

<p>Sounds good to me. So we can decide later if we need a dmri category. Thank you Isaiah for setting this up!</p>

## Post #4 by @bpaniagua (2017-04-10 12:44 UTC)

<p>This is great, thank you! We will need a SlicerSALT category too.</p>
<p>For SlicerCMF, we have a<a href="https://sites.google.com/a/umich.edu/dentistry-image-computing/">google site website</a> but no forum so we will be starting a user-base from scratch.</p>
<p>For SlicerSALT, we have a large user-base in our <a href="https://www.nitrc.org/forum/?group_id=308">NITRC forums</a>. I would like to start migrating this user-base to discourse, but I know there will be resistance and it will take a bit of time. Any suggestions on how to go around this apart from saying “we are now here”?</p>

## Post #5 by @ihnorton (2017-04-10 14:04 UTC)

<p>Ok, I created SlicerSALT and added you to the moderator group so I think you can now edit the settings/header.</p>

<p>Make an announcement, wait a few days, then turn off the mailing list! <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/jack_o_lantern.png?v=12" title=":jack_o_lantern:" class="emoji" alt=":jack_o_lantern:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"> (well, set to read-only mode so people can still read the archives). If you have a decent # of subscribers it is probably worth sending a summary digest to the old mailing list (no-reply) for a while so that people see signs of life – that’s what I’m planning to do for the main Slicer lists.</p>
<p>I think the email interaction mode can take a little tweaking to get the way you want, but otherwise the user experience is so much better on Discourse that I hope people are generally happy to migrate.</p>

## Post #6 by @bpaniagua (2017-04-10 16:13 UTC)

<p>Yes, those are good ideas! We are going to wait anyways until the new SlicerSALT website and SPHARM extensions are ready to share.</p>

<p>What do you mean by that? Sending a digest of the discourse forum to the old forum for a while?</p>

</aside>
<p>Yeah, exactly. There is a digest mode where it will summarize all the activity, if any, on the list or in a given category (I think) for a set time-period, and we can set up a dummy account which would mail that digest to the old lists. I’ll try it out once we are ready to move the main lists, and report back.</p>

## Post #8 by @bpaniagua (2017-04-10 16:19 UTC)

<p>Yeah, please do! Also, is it possible to add multiple moderators to a community? Can we add the user hina-shah as another moderator in SlicerSALT?</p>

---

## Post #9 by @ihnorton (2017-04-10 16:45 UTC)

<p><a href="https://meta.discourse.org/t/category-specific-moderators-phase-1-rfc">Discourse doesn’t support category-specific moderators yet</a>, and, unfortunately, the number of staff in the Standard plan is limited to 5 – which we reached already…</p>
<p>I thought that 5 number only counted admins, but it doesn’t really seem like an issue: looking at the permissions for <a href="https://meta.discourse.org/t/what-do-user-trust-levels-do/4924">“Trust Level 4”</a>, it grants basically all necessary privileges (edit, close, split/move/pin topics, etc.) for management. There’s only a few things that TL4 can’t do compared to Moderator, like banning users. I don’t think this will matter much in practice.</p>
<p>So I think we should:</p>
<ul>
<li>give community moderators TL4 as needed (<a class="mention" href="/u/hina-shah">@hina-shah</a> has TL4 now)</li>
<li>we can re-allocate some Admin/Mod rights if needed (currently me, <a class="mention" href="/u/lassoan">@lassoan</a>, <a class="mention" href="/u/jcfr">@jcfr</a>, <a class="mention" href="/u/pieper">@pieper</a>, <a class="mention" href="/u/bpaniagua">@bpaniagua</a>)</li>
</ul>

## Post #10 by @bpaniagua (2017-06-21 17:16 UTC)

<p>I am modifying the <a href="http://slicer.org">slicer.org</a> landing page to include links to all of those slicer customized communities. In this initial attempt we will just link to their independent sites, and possibly just create a general page that describes what the SlicerVerse is.</p>
<p>I plan to link to several custom versions of Slicer initially: SlicerSALT, SlicerCMF, SlicerDMRI, SlicerRT, SlicerCIP…</p>
<p>Please let me know who else might be interested in being included.</p>

<p>Initial draft. <a href="https://bpaniagua.github.io/slicer.org/">https://bpaniagua.github.io/slicer.org/</a><br>
Please, pay attention to the slicerverse description page: <a href="https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Slicerverse">https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Slicerverse</a></p>
<p>Any feedback is appreciated!! Specific feedback I am looking for:</p>
<ol>
<li>Content in Slicerverse page in the wiki</li>
<li>Should the SlicerVerse row be a footer, header?</li>
<li>Stylistic comments (icon sizes ok? other icons?)</li>
</ol>
<p>Thank you!<br>
Bea</p>

## Post #15 by @pieper (2017-06-22 17:48 UTC)

<p>Definitely a good start.  I think I’m a little too close to this to know<br>
how it would look to a new user.  I wonder how best to get feedback from<br>
new users?  (not just about SlicerVerse but about the rest of the page(s)<br>
too).</p>

## Post #16 by @bpaniagua (2017-06-22 17:49 UTC)

<p>Oh, and I have not forgotten that <a class="mention" href="/u/rkikinis">@rkikinis</a> requested page wide images and a more modern look.</p>
<p>If we change the layout so dramatically, I would actually look into the plenty of (some of which) are free<a href="https://jekyllthemes.io/"> Jekyll Templates</a>. Or else, assigning this task to somebody that is not HTML challenged like me <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

## Post #17 by @ljod (2017-06-22 19:14 UTC)

<p>I like it! Thanks!!! I wonder if users will be totally confused by the term SlicerVerse. I remember we discussed possible names and “Solutions” was one, but that is still not too specific. Perhaps “SlicerVerse Solutions” or “SlicerVerse Projects” or packages? Stylistically I think the font for SlicerVerse is a little larger than the font in the Slicer logo above, so at first glance it looked too big to me (minor detail). Ideally it would be great if a mouse hover over a SlicerVerse icon showed the name of the package.</p>

## Post #18 by @lassoan (2017-06-22 19:25 UTC)

<p>I would call them “Distributions”, similarly to how it is done for ImageJ.</p>

## Post #20 by @ihnorton (2017-06-23 13:05 UTC)

<p>I like the header!</p>
<p>Other suggestion: the [alt] text for each link could have a little more description, both for those who can’t infer from the image, and for screen-reader users. e.g. <code>SlicerDMRI: diffusion imaging and tractography</code>. <code>SlicerIGT: surgical guidance and navigation</code></p>

---

## Post #21 by @ihnorton (2017-06-23 13:11 UTC)

<p>Oh, also: I would suggest the “Feedback” button to be changed to “Feedback and Help” and point directly here.</p>
<p>But if people want to keep <a href="https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/Nightly/Report_a_problem">feedback landing wiki page</a> in place (as a filter?), I’d like to simplify it a lot. The multi-level flow bullets, flowcharts, etc. are too busy.</p>

<p>I don’t like “SlicerDistributions” either. But simply “Distributions” could work. An advantage is that we could use the “distribution” (or “distro”) word to describe custom Slicer install packages.</p>

<p>The updated site that you created looks very nice, but it would be a good time to move on to a more modern look.</p>
<p>The Jekyll templates on the site you listed looks awesome. Can you try to create a Slicer main page using one of those?</p>

---

## Post #24 by @ljod (2017-06-23 19:32 UTC)

<p>This is nice but the <span class="hashtag">#1</span> goal was advertising in my opinion and from our initial project week conversations. Just provide a way for users to find the universe of Slicer* applications/extensions/distributions. While special slicelet simplification is nice, it is orthogonal to this basic need to increase visibility. Increased visibility==increased users==increased funding (we all hope).</p>

---

## Post #25 by @fedorov (2017-06-23 19:54 UTC)

<p>Lauren, if the goal is advertisement, then I would expect this goal should be achieved outside of Slicer without the need to change anything in Slicer, by just crafting a fancy web site. But it would be of limited use if the user is lured in just to be overwhelmed by the 100s of Slicer modules and extensions.</p>
<p>So it seemed to me that the goal was simplification of the software presentation from the user perspective, and advertisement of the resulting simplified tool.</p>
<p>Sorry, I think I am still lost.</p>
