<p>As we discussed I edited the main users’ page, see here<br>
<a href="https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/Nightly" class="onebox" target="_blank">https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/Nightly</a></p>
<p>The basic idea was to make it easier to find core modules, and make searching easier as well (no multiple results, no information that a user would find ambiguous or not useful).</p>
<p>What I did:</p>
<ol>
<li>Added a list of the main core modules with icons</li>
<li>Kept the table with the links for the different categorizations of the modules and extensions (this will be removed as it becomes outdated)</li>
<li>Kept only two lists on the bottom: extension list, and core modules list. Both are static, but it’s in the plans to generate both of these dynamically. It will be way simpler than the comprehensive report generated by the script in the past (and which was unstable due to various issues)</li>
</ol>
<p>Let me know what you think!</p>
