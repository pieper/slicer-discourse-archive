<p>While working on <a href="https://discourse.slicer.org/t/slicer-extensions-action-required-by-maintainers/1003">fixing some of the extensions</a> , we improved the migration guides and created a convenient page listing all of them.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/Nightly/Developers/Tutorials/MigrationGuide">https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/Nightly/Developers/Tutorials/MigrationGuide</a></p>
<p>The guides list examples of build errors, suggested solutions as well as some explanations and additional references.</p>
