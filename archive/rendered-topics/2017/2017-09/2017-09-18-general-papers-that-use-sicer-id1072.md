<p>Is there a general location for papers that use Slicer but don’t fit into the Surgical Planning Publication DB off <a href="http://slicer.org" rel="nofollow noopener">slicer.org</a>? Paleontology projects, for example. I seem to remember seeing a list of papers somewhere, but I can’t seem to find it.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Have you checked citations of <a href="https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/Nightly/FAQ/General#How_to_cite_Slicer.3F">3D Slicer platform papers</a> on Google Scholar?</p>

<p>There is also the Slicer Community section of the wiki:</p>

<p>I think the one Steve Pieper mentioned is the one I remember seeing. We have a study of a Cretaceous Hell Ant named after Vlad the Impaler, and we used Slicer to do some of the micro-CT segmentation and analysis. It’s a bit far afield, but I was considering adding it to the list of studies using slicer.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>You can also search the list of articles citing Slicer papers for the keywords of your interest in Google Scholar.</p>

<p><a class="mention" href="/u/hherhold">@hherhold</a> if you want to send us publications and/or screenshots with some description we can add them to the community pages.  I’m curious to see Vlad the Impaler in microCT!</p>

<p><a class="mention" href="/u/pieper">@pieper</a> Posted to community page. I largely copied the formatting from another post, please let me know if there are edits I should make to formatting, etc.</p>
<p>It’s not your standard “surgical planning” paper, but we used Slicer (and continue to do so)!</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
