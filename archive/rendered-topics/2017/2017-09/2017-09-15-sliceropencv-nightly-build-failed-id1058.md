<p>Hi guys,</p>
<p>SlicerPathology depends on SlicerOpenCV… I hope you can help me out.</p>
<p>Here’s <a href="http://slicer.cdash.org/viewBuildError.php?buildid=1097176" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">the build error</a>.</p>
<p>And it says:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">-- MD5 hash of
    /.../SlicerOpenCV-build/OpenCV-prefix/src/3.1.0.tar.gz
  does not match expected value
    expected: '70e1dd07f0aa06606f1bc0e3fa15abd3'
      actual: 'a0669e22172dfc3225835b180744c9f0'

 Each download failed!
</code></pre>
<p>Google search indicates a recurring issue that could possibly be resolved with a different CMake version.</p>
<p>Can you guys please help?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
