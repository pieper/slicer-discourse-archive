<p>I’m having problems with the color thresholds and numeric values for the foreground layer. I want to set the exact threshold where the value should change color.</p>
<p>Example: I have created a color template with 4 different colors. I want a range 0-20 to be red, 21-40 to be blue and so forth. I know how to make a user generated color lookup table, but I can’t seem to set user-specific values for color ranges. Further, the scalar bar to the right of the map shows numeric values that do not at all correspond to the values on the map.</p>
<p>How do I set these values?</p>
