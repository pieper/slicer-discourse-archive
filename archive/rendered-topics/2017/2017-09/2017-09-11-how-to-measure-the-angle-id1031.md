<p>Hello everyone!<br>
In 3D-Slicer software,is there any module can measure the angle between two or three,four thread in one plate?<br>
Thanks a lot!</p>

<p>You can modify this Python scripted module to measure angle between any number of lines (defined by rulers): <em>(link removed, see updated link below)</em></p>

<p>When i click the link,the result i got is “the webpage in not exist”!<br>
The module about angle measurement has not been finished,is it right?<br>
Thanks a lot!</p>

## Post #6 by @lassoan (2017-09-12 14:55 UTC)

<p>The webpage (<a href="https://gist.github.com/lassoan/9bf334743871e400f7e3b3745b312b14">https://gist.github.com/lassoan/9bf334743871e400f7e3b3745b312b14</a>) does exist and loads fine for me. Check your network settings and try again.</p>
<p>The preview in the post shows the first 10 lines, but the module is complete (see at the link), you can use it as is.</p>

<p>Hello,professor Andras Lasso!<br>
After I have tried some times,the webpage still can not been openned eventually.I checked my  computer and the web setting,but there was no problem.<br>
So I want to know is there any other methods or modules can measure the angle between two lines?<br>
Thanks a lot!</p>

## Post #8 by @lassoan (2017-09-17 15:50 UTC)

<p>The GitHub link above (<a href="https://gist.github.com/lassoan/9bf334743871e400f7e3b3745b312b14">https://gist.github.com/lassoan/9bf334743871e400f7e3b3745b312b14</a>) still works, I’ve just checked this again.</p>
<p>Which country you are in? Do you have access to github and gists on github in general?</p>

## Post #9 by @doc-xie (2017-09-18 06:47 UTC)

<p>hello,professor Lassoan!<br>
I am in China,probably the webpage was forbidden by “some authorities”.I do not know the reason.What I want to do is to measure the angle between two lines or three lines,the question troubled me for a long time!can you teach me some other ways or methods?</p>
<p>Thank you very much!</p>

## Post #10 by @lassoan (2017-09-19 01:06 UTC)

<p>Do you have access to github repositories? For example, do you see files in <a href="https://github.com/lassoan/Slicer">this repository</a>?</p>
<p>Do you have access to github gists? For example, you can try to create a gist and see if you can access that.</p>

## Post #11 by @doc-xie (2017-09-20 14:41 UTC)

<p>Thanks a lot,Professor Lassoan!<br>
I have registered an account on the GitHub web and I can open the repository you gave me.<br>
Because I am a new user of 3D Slicer,I donnot know what I should do next?<br>
Would you like show me the details about how to measure the angle between lines?<br>
Thank you very much!<br>

## Post #12 by @lassoan (2017-09-20 19:19 UTC)

<p>Add the directory where the .py file is located to the “Additional module paths” in Application settings / Modules section. If you restart Slicer then the “Angle measurement” module will show up in “Quantification” category in the module list.</p>

## Post #13 by @doc-xie (2017-09-21 05:49 UTC)

<p>Thanks a lot!<br>
But how can i get the *.py file?<br>
Is in my computer already? or I should download it from the link you give me?<br>
Thank you very much for your attention, Professor Lassoan!</p>

## Post #14 by @lassoan (2017-09-21 11:09 UTC)

<p>You download the file and save as <a href="http://AngleMeasurement.py">AngleMeasurement.py</a></p>

<p>I have tried some methods some times,but the webpage(<a href="https://gist.github.com/lassoan/9bf334743871e400f7e3b3745b312b14" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">3D Slicer scripted module for measuring angle between rulers · GitHub</a>) cannot be openned and I cannot find <code>**the file**</code> in the end.So the problem have not be solved.Is there any way can I get the file?<br>
Thank you very much,Proffesor Lassoan!<br>

<p>What file sharing service is allowed in China?</p>

<p>Thanks,Professor Lassoan!<br>
Do you mind send the file(*.py) to my mail account?<br>
My mail address is <a href="mailto:522802876@qq.com">522802876@qq.com</a>.<br>
Thanks a lot!</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I wanted to calculate the angle between two ruler lines in Slicer. I found the <a href="http://AngleMeasurement.py" rel="nofollow noopener">AngleMeasurement.py</a> file.<br>
But where should I put this file and I wanted to know the steps how to add that file in Slicer and how to measure the angle?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Similar question was answered here: <a href="https://discourse.slicer.org/t/how-to-measure-the-angle/1031/12?u=jcfr">How to measure the angle?</a></p>
<p>Otherwise, to provide some background, similarly to the <a href="https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/4.8/SlicerApplication/MainApplicationGUI#Mouse_Modes">ruler</a>, there is preliminary work to support angle and it would still need some work. Code can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/Slicer/Slicer/tree/master/Modules/Loadable/Annotations">Annotations</a> module.</p>

## Post #21 by @TheoK (2020-04-01 12:40 UTC)

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for the angle measurer. <a class="mention" href="/u/lassoan">@lassoan</a>, is there a way to define the module for  several rulers with a chosing panel to select the rulers ? I have multiple rulers for a project and I would require to be able to choose the rulers when needed instead of deleting every rulers after measuring the angle.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance,<br>
Theophile</p>

<p>Angle widget is available in recent Slicer Preview Releases. Let us know if they fulfill your needs.</p>
