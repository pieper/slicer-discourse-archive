<p>I am trying to use a dicom file from a Fundus camera to make a 3d Slicer image in Slicer but I am getting an error. Is this event possible with 3D Slicer</p>

<p>Do you have a publicly shareable example dataset for debugging?  (no patient information)  If not, can you post the details about the data, how you load it, and what error you are getting?</p>

<p>Please upload the anonymized or phantom test data set to dropbox, onedrive, or google drive and post the link here so that we can investigate.</p>
