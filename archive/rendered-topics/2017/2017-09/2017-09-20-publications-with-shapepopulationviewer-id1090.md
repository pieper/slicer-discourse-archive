<p>Hi Alex,</p>
<p>We have not published any papers on Shape Population Viewer. There is however, a <a href="https://www.nitrc.org/docman/view.php/759/2022/SPV_tutorial_PDF.pdf">very detailed tutorial</a> in the project page in NITRC.</p>
<p>The tutorial should provide enough information to describe the software in any manuscript. For citation, probably linking to the project page in NITRC will be sufficient.</p>
<p>I hope that helps!<br>
Best regards,</p>
<p>Beatriz</p>

<p>Can you use the Shape Population Viewer for statistical shape modeling?</p>

<p>Hi Steven,</p>
<p>Shape population viewer is very useful to look at a population of models at<br>
the same time. However, you cannot change or do analysis on these models<br>
using SPV.</p>
<p>Hope this helps!<br>
Best,<br>
Hina</p>
