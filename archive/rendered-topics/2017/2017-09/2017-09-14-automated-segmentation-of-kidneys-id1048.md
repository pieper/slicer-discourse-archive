<p>I just wanted to double check with everyone out there, is there any automated or semi-automated kidney segmentation modules that exist as I’ve noticed not all modules are evident in the nightly build? In addition, does anyone out there work on non-contrast enhanced ct images and have any advice on filtering methods/dealing the the segmentation of them?</p>

<p>It seems that this message fell through the cracks (probably because it was originally posted in the “Community” category instead of “Support”). If you still need help with this then let us know.</p>
