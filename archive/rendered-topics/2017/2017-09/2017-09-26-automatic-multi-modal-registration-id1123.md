<p>From hamed_neu (was reported as issue <a href="https://issues.slicer.org/view.php?id=4375">https://issues.slicer.org/view.php?id=4375</a>):</p>
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am working on registering the MR images on CT scans for having a more accurate estimation of recording cite and skull width in order to implant an electrode array in awaking monkey. It would be great if you guide me in this regard. It seems that Slicer doesn’t have a tool for automatic multi-modal registration.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>

<p>Did you look at the examples in the use case library?</p>

<p>CT to MR of the same subject should work well if the image quality is decent.</p>
