<p>Operating system: desktop<br>
Slicer version:4.6.2<br>
Expected behavior:good visualisation<br>
Actual behavior:lack clariy<br>
when i wan to load a dicom directory, when the directory contains dcm files.  there is no problem, but when  gt a directory where the file are named IM0, IM1, IM2… AND N THE FILES TYPE IT IS WRITTEN ONLY FILE, I AM GETTING A VERY POOR QUALITY IMAGES AN ONLY THE AXIAL VIEW IS SOMEWHAT BETTER.<br>

<p>Use latest nightly version of Slicer and the <a href="https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/Nightly/Modules/DICOM">DICOM module</a> to load DICOM images.</p>
