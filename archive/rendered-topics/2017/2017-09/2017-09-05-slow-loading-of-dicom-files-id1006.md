<p>I have installed slicer 4.6.2 and now experience very slow loading of DICOM files (minutes rather than a few seconds as with version 4.3). is there a way to fix this?</p>

<p>Hi Steven,</p>
<p>Please, download the latest nightly build available at <a href="http://download.slicer.org">http://download.slicer.org</a></p>
<p>We recently improved the loading of DICOM (5 to 10 times faster). See <a href="https://discourse.slicer.org/t/slicer-dicom-import-performance/922">Slicer DICOM import performance</a></p>
<p>If you still experience slow loading, let us know and we will have an other look.</p>
