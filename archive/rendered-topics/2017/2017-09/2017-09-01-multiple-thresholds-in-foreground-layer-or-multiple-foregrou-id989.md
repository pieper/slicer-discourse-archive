<p>Hi!<br>
I have a foreground layer where I want to make one threshold in the upper extreme values and a different threshold (with different colors) in the lower extreme values. In principle, I can see two different ways to do this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Setting two different upper/lower thresholds on the same foreground - is this possible?</li>
<li>Adding two different foreground layers - is this possible?</li>
</ol>
