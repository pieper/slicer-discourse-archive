<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I just want to know that Plus Remote extension is available in slicer nightly build version.<br>
This is the link I have seen for the plus remote module in slicer 4.3.1. So I would like to know if its available in slicer nightly build version. If so then it would be helpful if can anyone guide me with the tutorials and links.</p>

<p>I would recommend to use <a href="http://perk-software.cs.queensu.ca/plus/doc/nightly/user/ApplicationVolumeReconstructor.html">Plus toolkit’s volume reconstructor tool</a> to reconstruct ultrasound volume from pre-recorded file.</p>
