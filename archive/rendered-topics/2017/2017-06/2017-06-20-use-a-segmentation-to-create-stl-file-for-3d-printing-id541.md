<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have been hitting my head against a wall and can’t figure out how to do<br>
this. I think there is supposed to be a tutorial on this (<br>
<a href="https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/4.6/Training#Segmentation_for_3D_printing" class="inline-onebox">Documentation/4.6/Training - Slicer Wiki</a>)<br>
but the pdf tutorial file has been deleted.</p>
<p>I have a segment that has been generated by other software that I am<br>
importing. It shows up in segmentations module:</p>
<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://us1.discourse-cdn.com/flex002/uploads/slicer/original/1X/01047d98c8358cbfedfb7ccd37ba815e961f428b.png" data-download-href="/uploads/short-url/9066SpUwciAnP9RsLP0P7vNBrB.png?dl=1" title="image.png"><img src="https://us1.discourse-cdn.com/flex002/uploads/slicer/optimized/1X/01047d98c8358cbfedfb7ccd37ba815e961f428b_2_690x210.png" width="690" height="210" srcset="https://us1.discourse-cdn.com/flex002/uploads/slicer/optimized/1X/01047d98c8358cbfedfb7ccd37ba815e961f428b_2_690x210.png, https://us1.discourse-cdn.com/flex002/uploads/slicer/optimized/1X/01047d98c8358cbfedfb7ccd37ba815e961f428b_2_1035x315.png 1.5x, https://us1.discourse-cdn.com/flex002/uploads/slicer/optimized/1X/01047d98c8358cbfedfb7ccd37ba815e961f428b_2_1380x420.png 2x" data-dominant-color="696975"><div class="meta">
<svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use href="#far-image"></use></svg><span class="filename">image.png</span><span class="informations">3451×1052 302 KB</span><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use href="#discourse-expand"></use></svg>
</div></a></div></p>
<p>It is the red “helmet”, “roughbolusdesign” segment.</p>
<p>This segment right now is just air.</p>
<p>Ideally all I want to do is export the red cap volume that is already being<br>
displayed in the right window as an .stl file.</p>
<p>The only way I can find online is to do this through the editor module, but<br>
the segmentation does not show up in the editor module.</p>
<p>Any help would be appreciated</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>
Garrett</p>

<p>Use the Export tool in Segmentations to create a model:</p>
<p><img src="https://us1.discourse-cdn.com/flex002/uploads/slicer/original/3X/b/4/b474be29b8e6ab44b06011a66f05ece2f20b7e29.png" alt="image" data-base62-sha1="pKo41XZoYPd3Ah40HqbA95C5X1D" width="558" height="129"></p>
<p>Then use File-&gt;Save and select output type as STL.</p>
<p>I’m not sure what happened to that tutorial, but there are some instructions in the “How To” section of the Segmentations module documentation:</p>

<p>Thanks for the quick reply.</p>
<p>My export tab seems to look different than yours? Is there some setting I<br>
need to change?</p>

<p>It looks like that section was called “Copy/move segment (import/export)” in 4.6.2, but I think the functionality is the same. However, a general recommendation is to switch to the nightly slicer build – it has many improvements, and is stable enough for general use.</p>

<p>If I click the tutorial link, the PDF loads correctly. Maybe it was a temporary problem with the wiki file storage?</p>

<p>In the meantime it turned out that</p>
<ol>
<li>The PDF file was fixed manually, so it was not a temporary issue</li>
<li>The STL file was also missing, which I uploaded again<br>
Maybe there are other files as well that were affected by an issue with the file storage system of the wiki? Can we find them somehow?</li>
</ol>

<p>Implemented <a href="https://github.com/Slicer/Slicer/pull/919">direct STL file export from segmentation</a> - will be available in tomorrow’s nightly build.</p>
