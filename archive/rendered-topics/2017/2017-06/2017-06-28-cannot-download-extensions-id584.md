<p>Probably you are behind a firewall that blocks the Extension Manager. Try to manually download and install the extension using your web browser, as described here: <a href="https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/Nightly/SlicerApplication/ExtensionsManager#How_to_manually_download_an_extension_package.3F">https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/Nightly/SlicerApplication/ExtensionsManager#How_to_manually_download_an_extension_package.3F</a></p>
