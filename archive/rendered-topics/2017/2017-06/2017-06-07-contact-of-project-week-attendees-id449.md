<p><a class="mention" href="/u/tina_kapur">@Tina_Kapur</a> What would be the best  way to get in touch with attendees before and during the project week ?</p>
<p>Here are few options I am thinking about:</p>
<ul>
<li>shared a google doc with list of all emails</li>
<li>ask attendees to join discourse (and we make they are added to a project week" group)</li>
</ul>

<p>Should be better know, I just enabled the option <code>Allow users to join/leave the group freely (Requires group to be visible)</code></p>

<p>I think it’s a good idea to use Discourse for reaching project week participants but I think we should simply create a new topic (Project Week <span class="hashtag">#25</span> announcements) or maybe category (Project weeks) that participants should subscribe to, instead of using groups. Problems with groups: messages are not public, so people who join the group later will not see previous announcements; not obvious how to send messages (you need to use the “message” feature and enter the group name); groups and messaging are new concepts that users would need to learn.</p>

<p>The category “Project Week” already exist: <a href="https://discourse.slicer.org/c/community/project-week" class="inline-onebox">ProjectWeek - 3D Slicer Community</a></p>
<p>Since the group is only a convenience to allow sending a message to all attendees, creating a topic <code>Project Week #25 announcements</code> make more sense.  See <a href="https://discourse.slicer.org/t/project-week-25-announcements/450" class="inline-onebox">Project Week #25 announcements</a></p>
<p><a class="mention-group" href="/groups/projectweekattendees">@ProjectWeekAttendees</a>   Should we delete the group then ?</p>
