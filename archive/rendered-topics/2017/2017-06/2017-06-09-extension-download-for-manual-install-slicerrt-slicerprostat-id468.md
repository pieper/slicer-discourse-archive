<p>Operating system: Windows 7<br>
Slicer version: 4.6.2<br>
Expected behavior: Extension wizard should connect to appstore<br>
Actual behavior: Extension wizard hangs</p>
<p>Based on the feedback from other threads, it seems that the server for loading extensions is very slow.<br>
Is there a link to access the SlicerRT  and SlicerProstate extensions directly so that I can manually install them?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance</p>

<p>There was a temporary problem with the extension manager, but the problem was solved a few weeks ago. I’ve just checked it and Slicer 4.6.2 extensions are listed and can be downloaded without any issue.</p>
<p>If you have trouble accessing the extension manager, it is most likely due to local network restrictions. Follow these <a href="https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/Nightly/SlicerApplication/ExtensionsManager#How_to_manually_download_an_extension_package.3F">instructions for manual download and install of extensions</a>.</p>
<p>The latest stable version (4.6.2) is almost a year old. I would suggest to use the nightly version, which is stable and has many fixes and improvements compared to the latest stable version.</p>

<p>Hi Andras</p>
<p>Thanks for the quick response. This time the connection to your appstore<br>
worked. I was able to download the modules I need.</p>
<p>Thanks again</p>
