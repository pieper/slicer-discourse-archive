<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I received some FA and ADC images in DICOM to evaluate, but I needed the original DWI images to workup, according to your DWI tutorials. Since they were lost by the original owner, and I don´t have anymore samples to redo the Experiment, would there be an way to generate back the original DWI Images based on the FA and/or ADC DICOM?<br>
Thanks for your help.</p>

<p>What you ask for is not possible.</p>
<p>It’s like asking for generating the original data values when only the mean and standard deviation of a numerical data set was shared with you.</p>
<p>FA and ADC are rotationally invariant scalers that are summary scores (statistics) of the much larger original data.</p>
