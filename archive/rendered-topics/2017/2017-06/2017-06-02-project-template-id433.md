<p>Please use this template to create you project page.  This is how it goes… testing testing testing.</p>

<p>Tina/Jc/Steve/others were emailing about this, so we are creating some content to see how it would look…</p>

<p>Whether we use this for project pages or not we can still use Project Week as a time to get more users and developers using the forum.</p>

<p>For long-term archival wiki might be better, but for live collaboration the forum has a number of advantages, such as much easier to sign up, easier to edit, can subscribe to updates on individual projects/topics, better visibility to the rest of the community.</p>
