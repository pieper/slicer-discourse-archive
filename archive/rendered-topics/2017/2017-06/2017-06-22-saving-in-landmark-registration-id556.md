<p>Hello all,</p>
<p>Is there a way to save the transformation from a landmark registration without having to go to the transform module? There appears to be a problem when I apply the transformation from the LM registration on the transform module  because the file is not being saved properly ( And I am making sure to harden the transform first).</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>
Ivan</p>

<p>To save transformation, just click in the menu: File / Save, and click Save.</p>

<p>What do you do? What do you expect to happen? What happens actually? Can you attach application logs (menu: Help / Report a bug)?</p>
