<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I’ve been trying out the Gel Dosimetry module and I have two questions about the Line Profile tool.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Is there a way to delete lines after creating them? I would think there is one but I cannot seem to find it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is there a way to make circles or essentially non-linear lines with the tool?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Thank you for the help.</p>
