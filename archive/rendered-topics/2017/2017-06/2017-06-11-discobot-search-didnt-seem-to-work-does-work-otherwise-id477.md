<p>As a new user of Discourse for Slicer, I followed the forum usage teaching discobot, and when I got to the instructions for the ‘search’ feature, the search response never indicated that the search term was hidden in  the original first bot reply, though I did get there by scrolling up, and the search does seem to work fine in the forums themselves.  Probably not important for regular forum use, just thought I’d mention it.</p>
