<p>I’m attempting to compile slicer with VS2017, and I’m realizing the tutorials as well as the QT builds are for VS2013, is there any way around this that would work. I’m guessing, being pretty new to compiling, that I should just uninstall VS2017 and install VS2013, and follow the tutorials. Let me know if there is a way to proceed in VS 2017.</p>

<p>If you are ready to spend some time with investigating and fixing build problems then you may try to build with VS2017. Otherwise I would suggest to go with VS2013.</p>
