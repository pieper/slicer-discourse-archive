<p>Operating system:PC<br>
Slicer version:4.6.2<br>
Expected behavior:Is there a way in segmenting that I can Segment on one slide then jump several slides and segment again, and have the program segment the in between slides?<br>
Actual behavior: Workflow a little slow.</p>

<p>Yes, this is available in recent nightly builds of Slicer. Segment on selected slices and use “Interpolate between slices” effect to create a full segmentation.</p>
