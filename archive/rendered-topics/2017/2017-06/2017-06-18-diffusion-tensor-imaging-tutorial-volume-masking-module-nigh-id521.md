<p>Im in a DTI tutorial &amp; asking to install the version of the Diffusion Weighted Volume Masking module Slicer4.5 nighlty build posterior to Feb.23, 2016 and I cant find it. The download slicer says like this. Where should I get the older release of the nightly build? thank you.</p>

<p>Hi Ron -</p>
<p>Probably the 4.6.2 version will work for that tutorial.  Depending on what<br>
you find it would be good if you could email the tutorial author and let<br>
them know if it does or doesn’t work so the contents can be updated.</p>
<p>Best,<br>
Steve</p>

<p>Thank you very much steve, I am new with 3D slicer. I am an observer at Golby Brain lab at BWH and I have to further learn slicer so I can practice in the Philippines. I am happy to learn about 3D slicer.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Hi Ron,<br>
I realized we had links to old tutorial versions on our <a href="http://dmri.slicer.org/docs/">web page</a>, but they are now updated. If you found the tutorial from there, please visit again and use the updated tutorials (which should match the nightly version – please let us know if anything is outdated).</p>

<p>Hi Isaiah,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for the reply. I will definitely try all the brain tutorials and most probably if there are some questions in my mind I will definitely try to raise it soon for clarifications. I know being active here is the only way to learn the software.</p>
<p>Thanks and good day!</p>

<p>Hi Steve still the versions  4.6, 4.6.2 and 4.7 slicer has no diffusion weighted volume masking to proceed with the diffusion tensor imaging tutorial. The 4.5 version has, but the baseline b-value threshold parameter is not present.</p>
<p>There is a note at the page of the DTI tutorial that says:<br>
Note: This version of the Diffusion Weighted Volume Masking module is available in the Slicer4.5 nighlty build posterior to Feb.23, 2016.</p>
<p>I don’t know where to find that version. There is no posted older releases of the nightly version in the installer.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
