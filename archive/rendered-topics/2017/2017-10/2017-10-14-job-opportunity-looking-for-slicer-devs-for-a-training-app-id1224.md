<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I’m new to the forums and to Slicer. Hope this is the right place to post this. We are building an app for patient assessment and training for a heart implant. We are looking for devs to work on things like: echo simulation, in-viewport manipulation gizmos and several other things.</p>
<p>Please let me know if you are interested or if I should repost somewhere else.</p>
<p>Thanks much,</p>
<p>Max</p>

<p>Hi Max,</p>
<p>Kitware provides development support for Slicer, and we would happy to provide for your medical imaging or customization needs.</p>

<p>I’ve moved the topic from Community to the Developer category (where most developers are signed up for notifications) for greater visibility.</p>
