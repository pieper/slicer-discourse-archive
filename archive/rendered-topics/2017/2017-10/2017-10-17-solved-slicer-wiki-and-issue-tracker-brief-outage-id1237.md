<p>There was a brief outage of the <strong><a href="https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Main_Page" rel="nofollow noopener">Slicer Wiki</a></strong> and Slicer <strong><a href="https://issues.slicer.org" rel="nofollow noopener">Issue Tracker</a></strong> due to a disk-full condition on the primary partition.  The issue is completely resolved now and all systems are fully operational.  Sorry for any inconvenience.</p>
<p>Of course, the system alerted at 4am, but because those alerts were related to routine backups, the messages weren’t delivered until an 11am message sweep.</p>
<p>I’m putting a disk monitor in place for immediate alerting.</p>
<p>Thanks <a class="mention" href="/u/jcfr">@jcfr</a> for alerting us at 7am; however I didn’t see that until 11.</p>
<p>As an aside, we’ve got some exciting developments in <a href="https://QualityBox.us" rel="nofollow noopener">QualityBox</a> product/hosting/support, so will be working with you to update and upgrade hosted customers like the Slicer project.</p>
