<p>I am very new to Slicer, so I apologize for my ignorance. When I load 4D data into slicer, it is not detecting multiple volumes, it only shows the first volume. Is there any setup that needs to be done prior to loading in Nifti files?</p>
<p>Under volumes, I noticed that the number of scalars is 1 when it should be 6, for the 6 echos in the dataset.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>I’m not sure that loading of 4D data from nifti is supported, but if you can share a small sample file then I can have a look.</p>

<p>Here is some sample 4D data obtained from the nifti website. Slicer does not detect it as a 4D file.</p>
