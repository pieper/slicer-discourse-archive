<p>Hello Everyone,</p>
<p>The Old Dominion University (ODU) Vision Lab has been working to develop an external toolkit, scripted with Python, for the purpose of automatic tumor segmentation with 3D-Slicer.  Is there a preferred way to package this toolkit for release (i.e., file structure, cmake file, format, etc.) so it is consistent with 3D-Slicer requirements?</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>
~ Carrie</p>

<p>Use the template generated by Extension wizard module in a recent nightly version of Slicer. Once you have an initial version of your extension in a public repository you can send a pull request to the <a href="https://github.com/Slicer/ExtensionsIndex/">https://github.com/Slicer/ExtensionsIndex/</a> repository and we’ll give you detailed feedback.</p>

<p>Sounds like a great contribution - thanks in advance.</p>
<p>This tutorial tells how it can be done:</p>
