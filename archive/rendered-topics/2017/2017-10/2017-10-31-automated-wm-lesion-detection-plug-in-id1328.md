<p>Hi folks. I have just joined slicer as I wanted to find an extension for automatic white matter lesion detection in T1 MR images. The paper below mentioned a plug-in for 3D Slicer but I cannot find it:</p>

<p>Could anyone help point me in the right direction?</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>

<p>Probably the authors have not submitted their extension to the Slicer app store and it seems that they do not read the forum. The best would be to contact them directly. If they are ready to publish their extension but having difficulties then we would be happy to help.</p>

<p>I didn’t find any announcements or any other discussion from that group on the old mailing list. The first author appears to have a company now in the UK.</p>
