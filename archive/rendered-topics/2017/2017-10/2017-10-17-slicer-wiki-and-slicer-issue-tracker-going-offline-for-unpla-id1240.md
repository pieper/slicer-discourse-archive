<p>Unfortunately, the earlier disk-full issue propagated to the <a href="http://na-mic.org" rel="nofollow noopener">na-mic.org</a> database which has crashed. Online attempts to repair it have failed. We will be taking the database server offline temporarily while we repair or restore the <a href="http://na-mic.org" rel="nofollow noopener">na-mic.org</a> wiki database.</p>
<p>This will affect all database services on this node: <a href="http://slicer.org" rel="nofollow noopener">slicer.org</a> Wiki and Slicer Issue Tracker</p>
<p>This discourse forum is NOT affected and will remain online during the maintenance.</p>

<p>The database server is live again.  All services are up and running.  (The NAMIC database was successfully repaired.)</p>
<p>Again, sorry for any inconvenience.  If you notice further problems, please post in this forum.  Thanks!!</p>
