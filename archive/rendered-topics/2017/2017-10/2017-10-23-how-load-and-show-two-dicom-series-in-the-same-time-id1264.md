<p>Operating system:Ubuntu 14<br>
Slicer version: 4.6</p>
<p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>I have different sequences of 2D cine-MR images for the same patient. Assume one sequence is a axial and another one is a coronal view. How can I show the first sequence in the red slice of 3D slicer and second sequence in the yellow slice of the slicer?</p>
<p>Consider since the sequences are cine-MRI, the coronal view of the axial sequence has no information and it is not important for me. Instead of it I want to show coronal sequence.</p>
<p>Any help is appreciated!</p>
