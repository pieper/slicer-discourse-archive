<p>Hello.</p>
<p>Does it exist Slicer Extension or any another way to solve my problem.<br>
I want to get ability to create simple lines and 3D flat planes in DICOM viewer window, just for bones geometry estimation purposes. And then get ability to save it in any open format (STL?) to export it for CAD instruments.</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Segment Editor module can do this. Created segments can be exported to Model nodes and saved as STL files.</p>
