<p>It is convenient to have staging area to maintain and test patches that are being contributed back to official repositories.</p>
<p>The following wiki page outlines the naming convention for branches pushed to such fork: <a href="https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/Nightly/Developers/ProjectForks">https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/Nightly/Developers/ProjectForks</a></p>
<p>Also, by default when visiting most of these projects on GitHub you will now see the content of a <code>welcome</code> branch and its associated <code>README.md</code> including answers to questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is this project ?</li>
<li>What is the branch naming convention ?</li>
<li>How to update the version of NameOfProject ?</li>
</ul>
<p>We hope that this will enable more developer to contribute and help reduce the bus factor.</p>
<p>For example, see:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Slicer/ITK">https://github.com/Slicer/ITK</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Slicer/VTK">https://github.com/Slicer/VTK</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/commontk/PythonQt">https://github.com/commontk/PythonQt</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/commontk/DCMTK">https://github.com/commontk/DCMTK</a></li>
</ul>
