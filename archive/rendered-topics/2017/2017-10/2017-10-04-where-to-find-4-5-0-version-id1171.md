<p>A new version of the slicer is great, but it lost the feature of “*.ply” format export of the generated surface (which I then use for further analysis in my software). Is there 4.5.0 version available somewhere? On download page there are only 2.4 to 3.6 versions.</p>

<p>Is there a specific module you are referring to? .ply is still available as an export option in the “Save Data” dialog:</p>

<p>For export with colors see: <a href="https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/Nightly/ScriptRepository#Export_model_to_Blender.2C_including_color_by_scalar" class="inline-onebox">Documentation/Nightly/ScriptRepository - Slicer Wiki</a></p>
<hr>
<p>As for older versions, they are still available by clicking “older releases” on the download page – however, using a nightly version is highly recommended because there have been major improvements since 4.5 and 4.6, especially to segmentation tools (Segment Editor).</p>
