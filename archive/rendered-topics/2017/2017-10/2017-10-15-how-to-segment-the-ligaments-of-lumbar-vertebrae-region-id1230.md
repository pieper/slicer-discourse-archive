<p>As i know the position of  lumbar  vertebrae, intervertebae disc and spinal cord, i adjusted the threshold value<br>
when these region were captured but i don’t know much about the ligaments then  how to proceed?</p>
<p>is there any  module directly show the ligaments just like arteries and viens?</p>

<p>What imaging modality do you use? Are ligaments easily distinguishable from surrounding tissues?</p>

<p>hello sir thankyou<br>
what i understand by imaging modality is which type of medical file/data  i am using.<br>
i am using CT- scan (downloaded from internet).<br>
No, ligaments were not visible with the adjustment of threshold intensity.<br>
I do not know much about ligaments but when i was reading journals they mentioned these ligaments are present in lumbar region:<br>
posterior longitudinal ligament<br>
anterior   longitudinal ligament<br>
ligament-um flavum<br>
interspinous ligament</p>
