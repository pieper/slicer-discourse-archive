<p>Operating system: Windows<br>
Slicer version: 3D Slicer 4.6.2<br>
Expected behavior: Not sure (I’m new) but not whats happening<br>
Actual behavior:<br>
Sorry I’m new to this… Only got it yesterday, I’m trying to play with dicom files from an ultrasound. I load this file &gt; go to the Volume Rendering module &gt; Select “MR Default” under presets &gt; then push the “eye” button to the left of Volume. at this point a warning comes up saying "SlicerApp-real.exe has stopped working. then the programme closes.</p>
<p>I’m trying to run through a youtube demo, that’s where i’m getting this process from. As I said I’m very new and don’t even know my way around this software yet. I do love it so far, such a powerful programme. I just wish I could find out how to do what I want.</p>
<p>If anyone could tell me whats wrong or what I’m doing wrong I would greatly appreciate it.</p>
<p>Thanks Dale Goldfinch</p>

<p>4.6.2 should not be used, it is outdated. Please try the nighlty, and if you still experience the crash, provide detailed steps to reproduce the problem.</p>

<p>Thanks you Andrey, I’m downloading it now… I didn’t notice the 4.6.2 was so old.</p>
<p>I’ll get back in touch if I struggle</p>
