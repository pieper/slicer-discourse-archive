<p>Dear Bea,<br>
Running the shape_analysis mancova I get the following error:</p>
<p>No groups were found in file /home/olof/Desktop/TotalSubiculum_R/Step3_ParaToSPHARMMesh/02c57db6-7b88-47b9-9ac2-0206a78bb6f1_Subic_R.meta</p>
<p>However a group number is  present for this subject.  As I have 900 subjects I tried to remove this subject but then this error is found in a  new subject.</p>
<p>Is this error due to something else?</p>

<p>Hi Olof,</p>
<p>How does the input csv that you use for Shape Analysis Mancova look like? I would recommend using a plain text viewer to see if you can detect wrong end of line characters or other file problems.</p>
<p>Thank you,<br>
Bea</p>
