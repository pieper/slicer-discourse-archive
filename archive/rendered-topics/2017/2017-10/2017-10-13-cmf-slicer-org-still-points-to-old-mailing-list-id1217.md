<p>Hi -</p>
<p>I noticed that the <a href="http://cmf.slicer.org">cmf.slicer.org</a> web page has mailto links to the slicer-users mailing list, but should be updated to point to this discussion forum.</p>

<p>Hi Steve,</p>
<p>Thank you so much for pointing this out!! I included my email as contact about it, but added the forum in the documentation section of the web. Does this sound good???</p>
<p>Also, I will add you as contributor to the page, so you can introduce changes if you want <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>Best,<br>
