<p>Someone can give me a hand with the extension airway segmentation, because I don´t know how to make it work. I’ve tried to prove it with the CT chest example dicom but it never renders anything.</p>
<p>Help please!</p>

<li>What behavior you expected</li>
<li>What happened instead</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Hello <a class="mention" href="/u/cpinter">@cpinter</a>. Thank for your answer</p>
<p>I´m trying to segmentate trachea and main bronchi form CT chest images. There is a slicer model called airway segmentation that I intended to use for that purpose. But I couldn´t make it work, after giving it the fiducial point inside the trachea nothing got rendered when I clicked over the apply button, instead a red dot appeared  where there should have appeared the complete segmentation. Finally I got the trachea segmentated using the tool “level tracing effect”, it isn’t automatic but it isn’t either too much time consuming. Nevertheless i’d prefer automatic segmentation, if possible.</p>
<p>Some counsel???</p>

<p>You may also try modules of CIP extension - <a href="https://chestimagingplatform.org/">https://chestimagingplatform.org/</a></p>
