<p>Hi Slicer,</p>
<p>Today, we will <strong>NOT</strong> have our regular office hour.</p>
<p>Waiting next week meeting, do not hesitate to ask questions on the forum.</p>
<p>Also, if you haven’t <a href="https://blog.kitware.com/3d-slicer-4-8-gets-released-with-improved-dicom-support-and-segmentation-capabilities/">read the news</a>, Slicer 4.8 is out and available for download. See <a href="http://download.slicer.org">http://download.slicer.org</a></p>
