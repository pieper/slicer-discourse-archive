<p>Operating system: Windows 10<br>
Slicer version:4.7<br>
Expected behavior: Chest Imaging Platform body comp and parenchyma subtype training working<br>
Actual behavior: Unable to color in tissue on body comp, Fiducial points for different types showing up as “F-1, F-2…” instead of “nodule,carina,etc.”</p>
<p>I think I need to go through a DICOM reader and export them as a different file before uploading them to Slicer, but I don’t know what DICOM reader to use.</p>

<p>If you see the CT image appear correctly in Slicer then it is not likely that the issue is with DICOM reading.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/raul">@raul</a> can you help here?</p>
