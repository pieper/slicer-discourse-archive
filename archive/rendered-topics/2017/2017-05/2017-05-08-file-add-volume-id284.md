<p>Hi</p>
<p>I have not used 3D slicer at all before, only, Mimics (Materialise). I see in a tutorial that there is a choice “add volume” under File but I dont have that option. Does anyone know why or where I can find that option?</p>

<p>You can load data by drag-and-dropping a file or folder to the Slicer main window; or use menu: File / Add Data or File / DICOM.</p>
<p>I would recommend to use latest nightly version of Slicer and corresponding training materials:<br>
