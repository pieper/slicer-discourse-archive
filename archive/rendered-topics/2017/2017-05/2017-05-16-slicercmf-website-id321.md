<p>Hi!</p>
<p>Beatriz created a very nice website where you can have access to the different tools we developed and download the latest version of SlicerCMF.</p>
<p>The link is <a href="http://cmf.slicer.org/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://cmf.slicer.org/</a>, you can find on the website more links about our team, some citations and more documentation about SlicerCMF and our tools.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
