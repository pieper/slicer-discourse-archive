<p>I am a new user of Slicer and am trying to make a model from a set of segments. I have tried using the Model Maker module but it seems to involve label maps whereas I have segments. Am I correct in thinking these are two different things? If they are, how do I make a model from segments?</p>

<p>Thanks for your reply. Could you help me further? I tried expanding Copy/move segment (import/export) in Segmentations but I can’t see a way to select the output type and click Export. I also tried right clicking the Segmentation node in the Data module but there was no option to Export.</p>
