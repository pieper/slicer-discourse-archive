<p>Agenda for today’s hangout is available at:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Developer_Meetings/20170523" class="onebox" target="_blank">https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Developer_Meetings/20170523</a></p>
<p>The plan is to talk about:</p>
<ul>
<li>use of GDCM vs DCMTK in Slicer core</li>
<li>definitive transition away from mailing list to discourse</li>
</ul>
<p>That said, since a lot of folks are working on the NAC renewal, i anticipate it will be a short hangout and I will plan on connecting at 10am for few minutes.</p>
