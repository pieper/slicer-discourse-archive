<p>Hi,<br>
I’m an orthodontist and I’m working to Slicer predominantly for converting Dicom files (ct and cbct) To stl format.<br>
I’m having issues with crop volume module and editor module.<br>
Once I’ve selected my ROI when I click crop volume the entire selected volume disappears from the top right hand window and only the boundary outline and a blue background remain.</p>
<p>And when I click on make model effect and select save I cannot find the save in stl format for CT bone or under any other menu.</p>
<p>Kindly help.<br>
Thanks<br>
Sarvraj</p>

<p>Please try with the latest nightly version of Slicer and let us know if you still have problems.<br>
It is also strongly recommended to use the new <code>Segment editor</code> module instead of the old <code>Editor</code> (see <a href="https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/Nightly/Training#Segmentation_for_3D_printing">this tutorial</a> for an introduction).</p>
