<p><a class="mention" href="/u/bpaniagua">@bpaniagua</a> and I were attending the meeting and we discussed  what would be the next step to have the <a href="http://slicer.org">slicer.org</a> website content hosted on GitHub and server from the current server and we came up with this approach:</p>

  <blockquote>
    During the weekly developer hangout, <a class="mention" href="/u/bpaniagua">@bpaniagua</a> and I talk about this, and we suggest to setup a cron job on the server that is currently serving “<a href="http://slicer.org">slicer.org</a>” ? 
A cron job like this one (running every minutes) should do the work: 
SITE_DIR=/path/to/slicer.org
if [[ ! -d $SITE_DIR ]]; then
  git clone https://github.com/Slicer/slicer.org $SITE_DIR
fi
cd $SITE_DIR
git fetch origin
git reset --hard origin/gh-pages
