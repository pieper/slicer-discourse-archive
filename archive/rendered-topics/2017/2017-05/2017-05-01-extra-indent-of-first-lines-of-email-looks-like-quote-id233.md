<p>When I get an email of a post, the first line are indented as shown in the following picture.  This is always a little confusing because it looks like it is a quote of someone else’s post (e.g. when I get an issue email from github it shows up with the quote indented just like this).</p>

<p>Does anyone know how to turn off this indent?</p>
