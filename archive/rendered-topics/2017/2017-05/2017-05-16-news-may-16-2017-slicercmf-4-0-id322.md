<p>Hi,</p>
<p>We have:</p>
<ul>
<li>Incorporated a dozen of SlicerCMF specific plugins for volume images for example from Cone Beam Computed Tomography, as well as digital surface models.</li>
<li>Created a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/DCBIA" rel="nofollow noopener">YouTube channel</a> with 18 videos that have reached viewers in 98 different countries, with a total of 12,812 views, and 26,894 minutes watched.</li>
<li>Continuously updated SlicerCMF, a customized version of 3D Slicer for dental researchers. SlicerCMF has a <a href="http://cmf.slicer.org/" rel="nofollow noopener">website</a> and a <a href="https://discourse.slicer.org/c/community/slicercmf">forum</a> where researchers can go to get help and advice.</li>
<li>SlicerCMF supports patient-specific decision-making and assessment of the disease progression via registration of serial images. Open source development made it easy to incorporate the Slicer community expertise, including leading biomedical researchers around the world.</li>
</ul>
