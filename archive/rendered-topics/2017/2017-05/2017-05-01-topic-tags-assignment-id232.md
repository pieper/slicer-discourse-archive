<p>Can someone please enable the feature to allow users assign tags?</p>
<p>In other instances of Discourse, I see this is typically the default.</p>
<p>At the very least, the submitter of the topic should be able to assign tag to the topic being created!</p>

<p>Do you mean that you cannot create new tags or cannot choose from existing tags?</p>
<p>All users should be able to assign tags and users above trust level 1 (very basic) should be able to enter new tags. You are already at trust level 2, so you should be able to create new tags.</p>
<p>It’s probably a good idea to keep the trust level 1 threshold for new tag creation to prevent first-time posters to create new tags. Currently, trust level 1 can be achieved by entering 5 topics, reading 5 posts, and spending 10 minutes on the site.</p>

<p>I don’t know what is my trust level, but I was unable to create a new tag when I tried.</p>

<p>Was it from a mobile browser? How did you try to create the new tag? Can you share a screencast that shows your attempt?</p>

<p>I changed “create new tags” from TL3 to TL1 shortly after <a class="mention" href="/u/fedorov">@fedorov</a>’s first post, but didn’t have a chance to respond.</p>
