<p>Question originally <a href="http://slicer-users.65878.n3.nabble.com/A-question-for-OS-X-support-td4032255.html">posted</a> on slicer-users@bwh.harvard.ed.</p>
<p>Dear SlicerSALT team,</p>
<p>First appreciate for this amazing update.<br>
However, Girder compiled version seems not works in OS X 10.12 Sierra.<br>
Currently, does it support only 10.11?</p>
<p>p.s. I resolved it via make symbolic link of qt to the location SlicerSALT refer.<br>
p.s.2 statistical functions are not yet fully implemented, right?</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Thank you for showing your interest in SlicerSALT, and also for reporting the issue with Mac packages.</p>
<p>Yes, we are currently under a heavy development phase, but will make an announcement about SlicerSALT once we have a stable initial release.</p>
<p>Thanks!<br>
Hina</p>
