<p>Hi!  <a class="mention" href="/u/fedorov">@fedorov</a> I’m tagging you in this one since you and I had a conversation about it a couple of days ago.  It looks like the nightly build is not pulling from what’s currently in Github.</p>
<p>I’m checking CDash for clues… all I can see is the Update/Revision column doesn’t have anything in it.</p>
<p>The downloads page still says it was built 2017-05-09.  <div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://us1.discourse-cdn.com/flex002/uploads/slicer/original/1X/7f3706fb8611c570cfa75aa15b4c1e37e8adc3c3.jpg" data-download-href="/uploads/short-url/i9ox7eK73xAmK2UEUcvyxw0PcVt.jpg?dl=1" title="Nightly Build.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow ugc"><img src="https://us1.discourse-cdn.com/flex002/uploads/slicer/optimized/1X/7f3706fb8611c570cfa75aa15b4c1e37e8adc3c3_2_690x112.jpg" width="690" height="112" srcset="https://us1.discourse-cdn.com/flex002/uploads/slicer/optimized/1X/7f3706fb8611c570cfa75aa15b4c1e37e8adc3c3_2_690x112.jpg, https://us1.discourse-cdn.com/flex002/uploads/slicer/optimized/1X/7f3706fb8611c570cfa75aa15b4c1e37e8adc3c3_2_1035x168.jpg 1.5x, https://us1.discourse-cdn.com/flex002/uploads/slicer/optimized/1X/7f3706fb8611c570cfa75aa15b4c1e37e8adc3c3_2_1380x224.jpg 2x" data-dominant-color="FCF9EF"><div class="meta">

</div></a></div></p>
<p>And this is regarding release: <a href="http://download.slicer.org/bitstream/632435" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">version 4.7.0 revision 26007 built 2017-05-09</a>.</p>
<p>A symptom of the non-rebuild is when I run Slicer, SlicerPathology is still showing the old debug output.  And… it’s not working the same as the current code.</p>
<p>Current tag v1.2.4 has been re-created.  So, the build should have picked it up, no?</p>
<p>Please advise.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Yes, it seems that due to some reason the download page is not updating. <a class="mention" href="/u/mhalle">@mhalle</a> do you know what could be the problem?</p>
<p>In the meantime, you can download packages from the dashboard directly (small yellow package icons in the Build name column).</p>

<p>Thank you <a class="mention" href="/u/lassoan">@lassoan</a>.  Also, the download page says 2017-05-09, but the names of the actual download are 2017-05-06.</p>

<p>That’s normal: there were no commits between May 6 and 9.</p>

<p>Please forgive my naiveté, but – commits to where…?<br>
Each of the slicer-extension repositories on GitHub (like <a href="https://github.com/SBU-BMI/SlicerPathology" rel="nofollow noopener">ours</a>)?<br>
The <a href="https://github.com/Slicer/ExtensionsIndex" rel="nofollow noopener">ExtensionsIndex</a>?<br>
Or do you mean <a href="https://github.com/Slicer/Slicer" rel="nofollow noopener">Slicer</a> itself?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Slicer is built from Slicer/Slicer on GitHub. I meant that there were no commits in that repository between May 6 and 9: <a href="https://github.com/Slicer/Slicer/commits/master">https://github.com/Slicer/Slicer/commits/master</a></p>

<p><a class="mention" href="/u/jcfr">@jcfr</a> The original issue is still there: <a href="http://download.slicer.org/">http://download.slicer.org/</a> shows that the latest release is May 9, while it’s May 17 now and there have been several new releases since then (available on Midas)</p>
