<p>I am running Slicer 4.6.2 on Windows 10. I can use the “Draw” tool to generate parallel 2D segments, but the “Fill Between Slices” tool does not show up in the “Effects” panel as described in the “readthedocs” page. Is there a trick to interpolate the volume between slices? Should I use a different tool, or file a bug report? Is this the right tool to draw overlapping or exclusive volumes? Thank you very much for your suggestions!</p>
