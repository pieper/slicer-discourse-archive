<p>JC, thank you for doing this, and for sharing the information about CII. I didn’t know about it, and it is a very interesting initiative indeed. It is nice that they organized all those items. But it does look like filling it out would require significant effort!</p>
<p>I just have few comments</p>
<blockquote>
<p>3D Slicer software is distributed under a BSD-style open source license</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We had a discussion about this before with <a class="mention" href="/u/mhalle">@mhalle</a>, <a class="mention" href="/u/pieper">@pieper</a>, <a class="mention" href="/u/rkikinis">@rkikinis</a>  et al - the sentence above is somewhat misleading. The fact of a matter is that Slicer license is not a BSD license. There is no such thing as “BSD-style license”.</p>
<p>How about “3D Slicer software is distributed under a permissive open source license that permits academic and commercial reuse of the source code”, or something along those lines?</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>These URLs are not accessible to me, even after logging into Mantis. It probably makes sense to only refer to the publicly available resources.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is SUGGESTED that the test suite cover most (or ideally all) the code branches, input fields, and functionality.  - Met</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We don’t test coverage routinely - do we have any evidence this is the case?</p>
<p>What do you think is the proper way to address security vulnerabilities, static/dynamic analysis?</p>
