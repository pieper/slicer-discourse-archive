<p>I thought this is an interesting initiative that might be of interest to the Slicer community: <a href="https://concepttoclinic.drivendata.org/">https://concepttoclinic.drivendata.org/</a></p>
<p>What is particularly unusual is how the organizers aim to mobilize the community around an open GitHub project to solicit solutions to specific sub-tasks. Here is the repo: <a href="https://github.com/concept-to-clinic/concept-to-clinic">https://github.com/concept-to-clinic/concept-to-clinic</a>.</p>
