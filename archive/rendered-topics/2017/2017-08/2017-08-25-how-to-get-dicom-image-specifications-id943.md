<p>Hello</p>
<p>I am now starting to use Slicer and I am having trouble finding the image specifications (Tesla, etc.).<br>
Is it possible to see the image specifications of an MRI volume with Slicer?</p>
<p>Thank you very much,<br>
George</p>

<p>To see all information stored in the image header, click ‘Metadata’ button in DICOM browser after you selected the image.</p>
