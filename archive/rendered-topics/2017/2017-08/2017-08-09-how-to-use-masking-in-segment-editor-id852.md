<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have been working with the Segment Editor and Segmentation with good<br>
success.  I am very new to 3D Slicer and wondered if there was a tutorial<br>
that would show how the segments (circles) were drawn in Slide 19.  I have<br>
been using the threshold effect, but cannot figure out how to use the “use<br>
for masking/paint” feature which I think draws the regions shown in the<br>
slide(?).  Any pointers to documentation or videos would be greatly<br>
appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>See <a href="http://slicer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/module_segmenteditor.html">documentation of Segment editor</a>. Search for <code>Masking</code>.</p>
