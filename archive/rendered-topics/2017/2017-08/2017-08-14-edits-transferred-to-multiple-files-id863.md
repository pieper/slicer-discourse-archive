<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>I wanted to make a major edit to a file I’m working on, so I saved two versions of my file in different folders. I edited one, but then the same edits were transferred to both files. I’ve had this problem before, is there any way to restore the previous version of the file and make sure it doesn’t happen again?</p>

<p>I use Slicer quite a lot and don’t remember ever having an issue like this. Could you explain exactly what you do? What file are you editing and how? How do you save it (open Save data dialog, check all items, select new directory, click save)? Did you get a popup that files are being overwritten or saving failed?</p>
<p>If you find it complicated to save relevant changes then you have to option of saving the complete scene in a single file, by clicking the package icon then clicking Save.</p>
