<p>Hi, I used to be able to respond to posts by e-mail, but this is not working.  Any idea?<br>
Thanks!<br>

<p>Just as a test, I reply to this post in email. We’ll see if it arrives.</p>

<p>See above, I’ve just tested replying by email and it worked for me. The email was sent to “3D Slicer Forum <a href="mailto:slicer+22decb950fee554f302534d43aaf7641@discoursemail.com">slicer+22decb950fee554f302534d43aaf7641@discoursemail.com</a>”. Do you see a similar email address when you try to respond in email?</p>

<p>Hi Andras,</p>
<p>Thank you, very helpful.  I learned that my e-mail client sends to<br>
the “Reply-to:” address when I choose “Reply”, but it sends to "From:“<br>
address when I choose “Reply all”.  The “From:” address generated<br>
by discourse is <a>"slicer@discoursemail.com</a>” which bounces.</p>
<p>Mystery solved.  Thanks!</p>
<p>Greg</p>
