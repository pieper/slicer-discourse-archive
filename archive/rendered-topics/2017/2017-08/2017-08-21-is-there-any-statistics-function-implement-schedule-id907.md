<p>ShapeAnalysis MANCOVA seems outdated.<br>
Is there any timetable for new stat function implementation?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Yes, we are working on a new statistical tool. The timeline should be that our new statistical package for shape should be released by the end of 2017 (if not earlier).</p>
<p>We will keep you posted.<br>
Best,</p>
<p>Bea</p>
