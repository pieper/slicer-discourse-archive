<p>Operating system: Windows<br>
Slicer version: 4.6.2<br>
Expected behavior: Airway segmentation of larger airways<br>
Actual behavior: For some reason every time I run the algorithm it manages to map some of the larger airways but not all. It has a tendency to stop mapping for certain airways at seemingly random points where it could have continued to map the the airway.</p>
