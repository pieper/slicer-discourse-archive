<p>Good evening,</p>
<p>Actually I’m trying to compile by using Cmake older modules from slicer 3.6.</p>
<p>The point is that when I try to compile all the files that are inside the folder (<a href="http://viewvc.slicer.org/viewvc.cgi/NAMICSandBox/trunk/BrainTissueClassification/?pathrev=6314" rel="nofollow noopener">http://viewvc.slicer.org/viewvc.cgi/NAMICSandBox/trunk/BrainTissueClassification/?pathrev=6314</a>)</p>
<p>Cmake tells me that some files are missing, so now I’m in a dead point.</p>
<p>The compiler I’m using is Visual Studio 14 and my Slicer version is 4.8.0.</p>
<p>Hoping hear soon from you,<br>
S.</p>

<p>This is an older module that only supported building against Slicer3</p>
<p>As an example for folks who would like to port older code to Slicer4, I will publish an updated version shortly.</p>
