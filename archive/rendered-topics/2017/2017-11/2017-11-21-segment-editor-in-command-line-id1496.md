<p>Is it possible to use the Segment Editor through the command line? I have &gt;2gb sized images and I know what are the options and parameters I would like to use from the application, it would be great to be able to run them non-interactively.</p>
<p>I was searching here <a href="http://slicer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/module_segmenteditor.html">http://slicer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/module_segmenteditor.html</a> but did not find any information.</p>
<p>Thank you!<br>
