<p>I’d like to create a histogram with vertical line markers for upper and lower range cutoffs. I don’t know how I can create the vertical lines. Another thing I noticed is that the widths of the bars in the bar chart don’t change as the size of the chart changes.<br>
Is there documentation I can look at for advanced chart features like this, or can anyone suggest how to handle these features?</p>

<p>See what you can do with VTK charts in this presentation: <a href="https://na-mic.org/w/images/1/18/NA-MIC-VTK-Charts-2011.pdf">https://na-mic.org/w/images/1/18/NA-MIC-VTK-Charts-2011.pdf</a></p>
<p>Probably the simplest would be to use “selection” for using different colors for inside/outside cut</p>
