<p>Hi Slicer,</p>
<p>Again today, we will <strong>NOT</strong> have our regular office hour.</p>
<p>Waiting next week meeting, do not hesitate to ask questions on the forum.</p>
<p>Regarding the transition to VTK8 and C++, this will happen after:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>a patch release 4.8.1 (as suggested by <a class="mention" href="/u/lassoan">@lassoan</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>linux dashboard is transitioning over to metroplex build machine</p>
</li>
</ul>
