<p>Operating system: Windows 10 Enterprise<br>
Slicer version: Slicer 4.8.0<br>
Expected behavior:<br>
Actual behavior:</p>
<p>I have 157 DICOM images that are broken down into single images. I need to combine them into one DICOM file. What is the best way to do it in Slicer, if possible?</p>

<p>If I understand your question correctly, you would like to create an instance of an enhanced multi-frame DICOM object from a set of single-frame DICOM instances. 3D Slicer does not currently provide such capability.</p>

<p>What about converting  DICOM  series into a single DICOM?</p>
