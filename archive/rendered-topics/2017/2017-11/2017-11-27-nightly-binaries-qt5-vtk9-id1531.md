<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I was just curious if there is a planned date for the release of the nightly binaries in Qt5/VTK9.<br>
A part minor bugs, it seems working quite well. Or is there any particular issue with the compiling/packing on the factory machines?</p>
<p>Cheers,<br>
Davide.</p>

<p>Before we switch nightlies to Qt5, we’ll need release Slicer 4.8.1 (probably in a few weeks).</p>
