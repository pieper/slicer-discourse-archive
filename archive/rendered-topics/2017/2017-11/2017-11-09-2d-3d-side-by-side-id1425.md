<p>Hi Slicers, I am doing some segmentations in 2D and checking the result in 3D as I move from slice to slice. Wouldn’t it be nice to be able to do a side by side between the slice you are segmenting and the 3D view? the only way to do this currently is by the 4-way view which is a waste of space that you don’t use. I would like for instance maximize the space of the slice where I am segmenting and have next to it the 3D view. What do you think?</p>

<p>It’s possible to set up custom views with a little coding:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/Nightly/ScriptRepository#Customize_viewer_layout" class="onebox" target="_blank">https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/Nightly/ScriptRepository#Customize_viewer_layout</a></p>
<p>If that view is particularly handy it could be added to the layout menu (but that menu is already so long…)</p>

<p>I also would appreciate, if this three views could be added:<br>
Red + 3D<br>
Yellow + 3D<br>
Green + 3D</p>

<p>Did you try the customizer python script or is it too cryptic?</p>

<p>Although it is quite easy to define your own layouts using Python scripting, I agree that it would be nice to be able to define and switch between custom layouts more easily. I think this issue covers this feature request already: <a href="https://issues.slicer.org/view.php?id=2384">https://issues.slicer.org/view.php?id=2384</a>. Add a comment there to indicate there is interest in having this feature (when we prioritize issues, having recent comments from multiple users puts an issue ahead of the others).</p>

<p>Is there a way to store my custom layout or every time I start slicer I have to do it again? Maybe put into the layout view selector?</p>

<p>Yes, of course. Either add the layout registration code to your application startup script (menu: Edit / Application Settings / General) or your scripted module initialization (triggered with a single-shot timer so that registration happens when Slicer startup is completed).</p>

<p>How and where do we add this code. I cant seem to find the mrmlLayoutlogic.cxx file</p>

## Post #9 by @akshay_pillai (2021-01-12 17:28 UTC)

<p>Can you please tell me where to find the MRMLLayoutlogic.cxx file to make these changes</p>

---

## Post #10 by @lassoan (2021-01-12 17:33 UTC)

<p>It should not be necessary to modify MRMLLayoutLogic.cxx. Nevertheless, you can find a link to the source code of this logic class and detailed description of how to register and use a custom layouts in the example referenced <a href="https://discourse.slicer.org/t/2d-3d-side-by-side/1425/2">above</a>.</p>

<p>Some user are pure clinicians that don’t have enough time / energy to put into learning a new skill like coding.<br>
As a matter of fact even the tech savvy ones are shocked when I they know I use slicer cause they think it’s too complicated , cause they want a software that do every thing for them in most straightforward way.</p>
<p>I still think the power of slicer is amazing but we ask for silly things to skillful programmer / user like you to help us make our lives even easier <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/laughing.png?v=12" title=":laughing:" class="emoji" alt=":laughing:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>
