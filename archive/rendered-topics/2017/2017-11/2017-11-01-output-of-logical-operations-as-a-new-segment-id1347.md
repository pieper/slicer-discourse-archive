<p>I am wondering if you can add a feature to logical operations of segment editor, such that the output of the logical operation can itself be a new segment.</p>
<p>As I have been using,</p>
<p>Segment_1 – Segment_2 modifies the original Segment_1. If I were to retain the original, I can copy it to a Segment_3 and run the operation that way. However, it is a bit cumbersome. And, I think, assigning the output of a logical operation to a new segment is more consistent with what I remember from other software (e.g., Analyze).</p>
