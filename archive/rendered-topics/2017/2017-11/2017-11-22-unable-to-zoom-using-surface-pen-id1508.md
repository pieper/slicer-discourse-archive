<p>Hi, I’ve been using Slicer on a MS Surface Pro using a stylus with a side button that serves as it’s right-click function. Today I opened up slicer and am suddenly unable to use the stylus button + vertical slide to zoom. Instead, it just adjusts the contrast as though I was L-clicking with a mouse or just using the stylus without holding the side button. Every other app, and even in the toolbar area of slicer, registers this as a R click, but in the segmentation view pane it doesn’t seem to register. Is there something that I accidentally changed/can change to get it to zoom again?</p>

<p>I don’t think anything is changed related to this. What version of Slicer still zooms with stylus button and what version does not?</p>
