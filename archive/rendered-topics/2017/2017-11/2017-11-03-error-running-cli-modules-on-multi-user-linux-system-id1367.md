<p>I have my moving, reference, and transform nodes loaded into slicer. I specify the parameters and hit Run, it fails with this errors (on Brains Resample, but same error occurs with Resample Vector/Scalar module as well).</p>
<p>Resample Image (BRAINS) command line:</p>

<p>While SLicer has some log files in the /tmp/Slicer folder, there is indeed no /tmp/Slicer/EHHFB_vtkMRMLLinearTransformNodeG.h5 file. But I already loaded the transform into Slicer. Any ideas? This is on Centos 7.2 with Slicer 4.8.0.</p>

<p>Does your user have write access to /tmp/Slicer?</p>

<p>Yes. (apparently that is too short of answer for discourse to accept it on its own, so here is my attempt to make it ‘meaningful’)</p>

<p>What if you try Prefer Executable CLIs?</p>

<p>Turned out to be multi-user issue. /tmp is writable by everyone, but Slicer directory last time generated some other user.</p>
<p>Anyways, on Linux I think it would make sense to default to home to $HOME/tmp or something of that sort.</p>

<p>It is a known issue (<a href="https://issues.slicer.org/view.php?id=4340">https://issues.slicer.org/view.php?id=4340</a>), it just never got fixed. Would you like to give it a try and change how the temp directory name is generated by default?</p>

<p>Unfortunately I don’t have the skills. I wouldn’t know even where to start. As the bug description says, if you know what the issue is, it is avoidable.</p>

<p>The fix is integrated into Slicer-4.9 version.</p>
