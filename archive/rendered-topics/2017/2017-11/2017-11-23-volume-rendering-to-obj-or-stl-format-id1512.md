<p>Hi Sir/Madam,</p>
<p>I’m using 3d slicer nightly build version and I am new to slicer. I tried using the slicer sample dataset ct chest and used the volume rendering extension. Is there any way to create model from volume rendering.</p>
<p>Thanks and Regards,</p>
<p>Suba</p>

<p>Main advantage of volume rendering is that you can display an image without creating a surface mesh. To create a surface mesh, use Segment editor module. See <a href="https://discourse.slicer.org/t/save-volume-rendering-as-stl-file/524">Save volume rendering as STL file</a> for more background information on this topic.</p>

<p>Respected Sir,</p>
<p>Thank you for your reply. The link you have sent is very useful for segment editor module. Is there any way to get a mesh from volume rendering volume.</p>
<p>Thanks and regards,</p>

<p>Volume rendering displays a volume without creating a surface mesh. It is not possible to save a mesh that does not exist. See detailed explanation here: <a href="https://discourse.slicer.org/t/save-volume-rendering-as-stl-file/524">Save volume rendering as STL file</a></p>

<p>It may be time to create a wiki page titled “Why volume rendering cannot be saved as surface?”</p>
