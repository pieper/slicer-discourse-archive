<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I wanted to calculate the angle between two ruler lines in Slicer. I found the <a href="http://AngleMeasurement.py" rel="nofollow noopener">AngleMeasurement.py</a> file.<br>
But where should I put this file and I wanted to know the steps how to add that file in Slicer and how to measure the angle?</p>
