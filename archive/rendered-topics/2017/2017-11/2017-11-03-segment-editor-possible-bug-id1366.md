<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am using the segment editor function and the system is crashing on me. After a long session of segmenting I tried to apply fill between slices and the system crashed and closed. I tried to restart my work but now when I want to use the brush tool it is not painting over the volume of interest. Is there a bug going on?</p>
