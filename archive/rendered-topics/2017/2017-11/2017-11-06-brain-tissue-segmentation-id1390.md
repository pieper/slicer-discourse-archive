<p>Hi,</p>
<p>On CT images, Is there an easy way to segment the brain tissue (the inner soft tissue area of the skull). I don’t need an exact segmentation, but rough estimation. I am trying to use the segmented mask/label as volume of interest to limit the similarity calculation for CT/CT registrations. It will be much appreciated if you have any suggestion…  If possible, in a fully automatic way, cause I have over 100 cases to segment… Any suggestion would be much appreciated.</p>
