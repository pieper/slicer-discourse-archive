<p>I’m studying the slicer resource code,but it’s too difficult for me to understand.<img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/disappointed_relieved.png?v=5" title=":disappointed_relieved:" class="emoji" alt=":disappointed_relieved:"><br>
Is there any document or website that explain how the slicer project works and the structure of the slicer resource code? further more, how to add my own C++ module to the Slicer?</p>

<p>I would recommend to try to accomplish some simple, well-defined tasks and learn along the way.</p>
