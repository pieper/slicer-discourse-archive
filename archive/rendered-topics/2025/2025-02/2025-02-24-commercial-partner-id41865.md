<p>We are interested in using the Slicer software to develop a commercial medical device product. Could you please guide us on the process to become a commercial partner.</p>

<p>Hi Sanjay - it’s great that you are planning to use Slicer in your work.  If you haven’t already, please review <a href="https://www.slicer.org/commercial-use.html">this material</a> and follow up with any questions.  We use the term “commercial partner” to refer to companies that participate in the Slicer community and may offer services of interest to the community.</p>
