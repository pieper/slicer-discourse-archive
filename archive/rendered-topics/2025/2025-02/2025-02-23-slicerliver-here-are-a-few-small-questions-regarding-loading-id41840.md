<p>After downloading and installing the slicerliver extension, in order to test the extension, when loading LiverVolume and LiverSementation data from the sample data module, it took too long to load. I guess it was a network transmission problem. I couldn’t get the data from the cloud. Is there any other way to get the data so that I can load it locally?<br>
Do I need to re-download the sample data every time I reopen 3D Slicer and use the SlicerLiver extension?</p>
