<p>Upon uploading my DICOM data to the application, I noticed insufficient contrast for effective 3D modeling of the skull, leading to an imperfect model with holes and bumps in unrelated parts. This issue is critical as it impacts a homework with only a few days remaining to submit my report, resolving it is of utmost importance. To ensure dataset integrity, I have verified the data using alternative software where it functions correctly . Despite my efforts with different software, the problem persists on Slicer. I kindly request an investigation into this matter and an update on potential resolutions or guidance on how to overcome this challenge. Your prompt attention would be greatly appreciated.</p>
