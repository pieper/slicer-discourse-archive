<p>Hi,<br>
would it be possible to differentiate warnings and errors in the Slicer Python console by using different colors? For example, displaying warnings in yellow while keeping errors in red.<br>
When dealing with a large number of messages, it can be difficult to distinguish between warnings and errors.<br>
Thank you very much!</p>

<p>In the log dialog you can toggle the different message types.</p>
