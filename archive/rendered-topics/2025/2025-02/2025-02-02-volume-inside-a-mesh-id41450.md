<p>Hi everyone!<br>
Is there a format that combines a mesh and a volume (the one contained in the mesh)? A developer can surely link each mesh to its corresponding volume but isn’t there already a format that gathers these informations? It seems that it is pretty much what label maps do, but the labels are not meshes, isn’t it?</p>
