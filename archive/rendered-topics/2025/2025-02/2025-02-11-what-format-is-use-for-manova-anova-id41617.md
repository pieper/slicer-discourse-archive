<p>I want to verify significance with disease groups.We performed PCA analysis of 3D SLICER and created warped models including PC1, PC2, and PC3. I saved it in .fcsv, vtk, and stl formats, but I would like to know which format I can use to do MANOVA or ANOVA.</p>
<p>Also, I would like to know if there is a way to perform a significance test in Excel, which calculates the covariance ratio in the output section.</p>
