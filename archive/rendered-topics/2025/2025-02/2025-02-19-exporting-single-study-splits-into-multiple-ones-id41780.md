<p>Hi,<br>
I have been trying to work with volume sequence. The study has multiple volume sequences, I generate a new sequence, and I would like to add the new sequence to the patient to re-export it back as dicom. But the Volume sequence export makes multiple studies with the same id and series name.</p>
