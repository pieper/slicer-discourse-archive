<p>I’ve come across several posts about this module, but I haven’t been able to get it working with a Python script. I want to extract the centerline of the aortic root and obtain orthogonal planes across the centerline for analysis. Could anyone point me to a tutorial or provide some example code that I can use as a guide?</p>
