<p>Hi everyone<br>
I have two DICOM CT images and I want to register them based on voxel intensity (not organ contour) using 3D Slicer software. Can you guide me?</p>
<p>1- Which of the registration algorithms are available in this software?(rigid, affine, DIR (b-spline, demons, …))<br>
2- Which module can I use for this?<br>
Thanks a lot</p>
