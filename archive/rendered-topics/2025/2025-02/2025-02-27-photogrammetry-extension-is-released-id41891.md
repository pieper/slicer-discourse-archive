<p>We have released a new extension, Photogrammetry, that integrates SAM to mask foreground in large collections of photos of objects and then submit them to the <a href="https://opendronemap.org" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">OpenDroneMap (ODM)</a> server that is launched locally to build 3D models with textures.</p>
<p>Extension repository is: <a href="https://github.com/SlicerMorph/SlicerPhotogrammetry" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">GitHub - SlicerMorph/SlicerPhotogrammetry</a></p>
<p>A short video of the functionality is here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRHlb0dGyNc&amp;t=9s" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRHlb0dGyNc&amp;t=9s</a></p>
<p><strong>Couple important points:</strong> Launching ODM server requires docker engine to be running on your computer. As such we chose to make the extension available only on Linux (due to complexities of getting docker running on Windows and Mac). The easist way to give a try is through the <a href="https://instances.morpho.cloud" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">MorphoCloud On Demand Instance</a></p>
<p>Kudos to <a class="mention" href="/u/oothomas">@oothomas</a> for building the extension.</p>
