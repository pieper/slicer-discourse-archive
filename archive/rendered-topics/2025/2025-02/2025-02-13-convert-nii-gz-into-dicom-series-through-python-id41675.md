<p>I did according to <a href="https://discourse.slicer.org/t/create-dicom-series-using-python/22871" class="inline-onebox">Create DICOM series using python</a></p>
<p>But it is throwing in getNode raise MRMLNodeNotFoundException(“could not find nodes in the scene by name or id ‘%s’” % (pattern if (isinstance(pattern, str)) else “”))<br>
slicer.util.MRMLNodeNotFoundException: could not find nodes in the scene by name or id.</p>
<p>I want python script so I can convert ni.gz files into DICOM series.</p>
