<p>Hi!<br>
Can you explain me, why after changing the volume geometry, the function “fill between slices” does not work. I mean, it works till I click apply, and nothing happens. Spaces between slices is not filled and it comes to normal when I change volume geometry to original (1.0)</p>
<p>Thank you in advance <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>
