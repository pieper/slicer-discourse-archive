<p>Hello Guys!</p>
<p>I am really new to analayzing a radiologic files from home. I am an ob/gyn trainee and my scientific topic is related to measurments of 3D uterine volumes especially ones with septum. My problem is that I can load the patiens list with 3D slicer, and it is definetely loading some volume informations since I can move through of 2D planes but I can not display the 3D volume like I can on our ultrasound machine during an examination. The upper right part of the slicer app is empty, there is no volume loaded, only the 3 pieces of 2D planes. I can neither display theser files on the machine (SAMSUNG HS40) even though they are saved on SSD as dicom files, for some reason the ultrasound machine wont even recgonize them. So is there any way I can display a 3D volume of the uterus and make measurments on it in Slicer or any other application? If yes what am i doing wrong?</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for your answer!</p>
