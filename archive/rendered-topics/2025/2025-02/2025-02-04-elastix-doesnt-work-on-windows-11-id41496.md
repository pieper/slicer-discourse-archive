<p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>I have installed the stable release of 3D Slicer 5.8 on Windows 11 and added the Elastix extension. However, when I run it, I get the following error:<br>
<strong>Command ‘elastix’ returned non-zero exit status 1.</strong></p>
<p>I have tested the same setup on Ubuntu, CentOS, Windows 10, and macOS <strong>without</strong> encountering this issue. It seems to be specifically related to Windows 11.</p>
<p>Does anyone have any ideas or suggestions on how to resolve this?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>
