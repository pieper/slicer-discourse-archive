<p>Hello All,</p>
<p>I am currently trying to segment  multiple muscles on a specimen, but when I try to fill between slices on each subsequent section it adds unwanted lines to my previous segments</p>
<p>The extra interpolation on either side of the yellow segment was not there until I tried to use Fill Between Slices on the brown segment. Is there a way to avoid this?<br>

<p>Hi, two years ago, a question was asked as well about the filling between slices.<br>
Merhan sent a very interesting replay about a module he developed and set in Githuh under the name “Slicer Spline.”<br>
Unfortunately this module can’t be found in the extension manager.<br>
Thus I sent the following message to Merhan…<br>
“Hi Mehran, I followed your link to Github; your module looks great; congratulations.<br>
I am working on a Mac as a “final user” without much computer science skills.<br>
I saw that you ran it on Unbutu. I downloaded the package from GitHub, but I do not know what to do with it. Is there a way to run it on my Mac?<br>
If so, how can I do that?<br>
It would be great if we could find it in the extension manager.<br>
Thanks for any help”</p>

<p>Can you please send a video grabbing the whole Slicer as you do this? There must be a small detail that you miss, but from this screenshot and description it is not apparent what it is. Thanks!</p>
