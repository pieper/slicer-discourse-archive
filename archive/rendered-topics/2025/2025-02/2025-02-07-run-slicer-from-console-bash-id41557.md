<p>Hello everyone, I have been a Slicer user for a few years, always from the graphical interface. Thinking about automating some tasks, I was thinking about the possibility of loading medical images, segmenting them and creating a .stl volume from the console using a script. Is that possible? Thank you in advance.</p>
