<p>Does 3D slicer uploads non Dicom data? Mistakenly selected a folder for upload and authorised upload while I was offline, I am concerned if the whole folder with pdf and word files has been uploaded? If yes how can I delete it, if not uploadabke then will get relief and will confidently use 3D slicer.<br>

<p>In general, if an extension uses a server to process data, all non-image data is discarded right away. After the processing completed, the image data is discarded as well.</p>
<p>What extension and module did you use?</p>
