<p>I’m new to using Slicer. I want to install Slicer-DTI-ALPS extension, I downloaded its files from github and I don’t know how to install it in Slicer 3D 5.8 software. Is there anyone did it before?</p>

<p>It should be in the extension manager, but it looks like there’s a build error:</p>

<p>I suggest contacting the developers via their github page: <a href="https://github.com/LOAMRI/Slicer-DTI-ALPS" class="inline-onebox">GitHub - LOAMRI/Slicer-DTI-ALPS: Slicer Module to calculate the diffusion tensor image analysis along the perivascular space (DTI-ALPS)</a></p>

<p>I found the extension in the older version (5.6.2), but I don’t know why it is not in the newer versions. Does anyone know?</p>
