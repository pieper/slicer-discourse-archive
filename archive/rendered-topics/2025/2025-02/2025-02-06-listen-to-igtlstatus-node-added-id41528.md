<p>Hello everyone!</p>
<p>I am trying to automatically query some data from a medical device immediately after it accepts the connection.<br>
I see that an IGTLStatus node appears in the I/O configuration dropdown of the OpenIGTLinkIF module, however I haven’t been able to successfully link an observer to the events I see in the C++ files from python.</p>
<p>Any examples on what would be the correct way to approach this?<br>
Thank you in advance</p>
