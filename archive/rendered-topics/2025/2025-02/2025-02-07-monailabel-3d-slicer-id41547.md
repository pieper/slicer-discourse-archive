<p>Hey everyone,</p>
<p>I’m currently doing an internship at a company where I briefly used MONAILabel through 3D Slicer for annotation purposes. During a pen test, it was discovered that the dataset in use was accessible via the IP and port. Is there a way to secure this with authentication, such as an API key or a simple username and password would also suffice?</p>

<p>I know there is an option “User/Client ID” on app settings (CTRL+2), tab “Monai Label”. Maybe that can be useful for you!</p>
