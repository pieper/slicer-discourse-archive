<p>I have done segmentations on 2 different image sets which i have saved. I subsequently done a registration on of these images and saved the transform file. When I load the data, do a transform of the one segmentation and then do a segment comparison, I get a different reference volume (under Dices similarity metrics) than what I get when I measure it through segment statistics. If I swop the reference and compare segments around, the reference one is different again. So, it seems it is measuring the reference volume differently than in segment stastics. Any ideas how to resolve this or why it is happening?</p>
