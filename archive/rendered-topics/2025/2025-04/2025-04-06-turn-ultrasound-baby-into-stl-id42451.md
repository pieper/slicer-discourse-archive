<p>Most likely you don’t have usable 3D data, because unfortunately 3D ultrasound imaging vendors typically prevent users from accessing their own data. This is sad and frustrating and this problem is specific to 3D ultrasound (does not happen with other imaging modalities, such as CT and MRI), but as long as hospitals that buy these systems don’t demand access, not much is expected to happen.</p>
