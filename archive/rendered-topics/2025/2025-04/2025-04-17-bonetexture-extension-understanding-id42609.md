<p>I’m quite novice here for the CODING, LANGUAGES &amp; Deep IMAGE PROCESSING.<br>
Yet, I have one task, where I have come to know about BoneTexture Extension.</p>
<p>I want to evaluate the <strong>Ossointegration/BoneGrowth</strong> of <strong>IMPLANT</strong> with the <strong>BONE</strong><br>
In this process I have performed Segmentation and Export it as a Label. Now If I use BoneTexture Extension, I’m getting Textured colored maps visuals on screen. But My Main Concerns are <em><strong>I don’t know how to Read this things! How to understand what feature indicates what!</strong></em></p>
<p>Can someone help from the community to make me understand how I can confirm the Bone&amp;Implant fusion/Osseointegration with this Extension?</p>
