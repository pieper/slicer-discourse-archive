<p>I’m really excited to encounter such an excellent liver segmentation module while attempting liver segmentation - it’s awesome! It achieves perfect segmentation in just 3 seconds. However, I’m facing an issue: When using the <em>SlicerRVXLiverSegmentation v1.1.0</em> extension, the 3D Viewer displays both the liver model and background skeletal structures, and I’m unsure how to remove the bone background. When using the <em>Segment Editor</em> extension, clicking the 3D Viewer shows blank images instead. Could you please guide me on how to resolve these issues?</p>
