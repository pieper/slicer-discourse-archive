<p>I am new to 3D Slicer and still learning how to use this amazing software. I need your guidance and help for a very important reason.</p>
<p>My son has severe to profound hearing loss, and we have completed both CT and MRI scans. Now we are trying to **measure key anatomical parameters of his cochlea, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cochlear duct length</li>
<li>Modiolus-to-lateral wall distance</li>
<li>Basal turn diameter, and other relevant measurements</li>
</ul>
<p>These measurements will help us (in consultation with our ENT surgeon) <strong>select the most appropriate cochlear implant electrode array</strong> for him.</p>
<p>Since I’m not yet familiar with how to do this accurately in 3D Slicer, I would be really grateful if someone experienced could either:</p>
<ol>
<li>Guide me step-by-step, or</li>
<li>Help with the measurements. if I share the CT/MRI DICOM files (I can provide the report CD)</li>
</ol>
<p>Please also let me know if there would be <strong>any charges</strong> for your time and effort—I am more than willing to compensate fairly.</p>
<p>Thank you from the bottom of my heart.</p>
<p>Warm regards,<br>

<p><a class="mention" href="/u/nagy.attila">@nagy.attila</a> you have a lot of experience with this part of the anatomy. Could you help here? (I know you just started your vacation <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=14" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"> Just asking now not to forget later)</p>

<p>Hi Mukesh!</p>
<p>Thanks <a class="mention" href="/u/cpinter">@cpinter</a> for the heads up <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=14" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>
<p>Well, based on my previous experiences, the choice of cochlear implant doesn’t only depend on the cochlear anatomy.<br>
That of course is important from the surgical perspective (modiolar electrodes, various cochlear development disorders), but also, the availability and the instrumentation and experiences of the given Cochlear Implant Center are important.<br>
Surgery is only a part of the overall story, and I’d even say, that is one of the easiest part. The kid needs follow up programming/setting (usually called “fitting”) of the device for years. Different CI devices provide different tools for that. There is no “better” or “best” option; according to our previous experiences all that we know/used provide decent results; it mostly comes down to individual differences in hearing development, and habilitiation/rehabilitation therapy.<br>
Also, if there is also some hearing residue, that can be spared with modern devices.<br>
Has a genetic panel been done? I’m asking because you mention some “severe to profound” hearing loss, which may indicate that some hearing still present. But - depending on the genetic data - it may get worse, and in that case the current situation does not matter in this regard.</p>
<p>I’d be more than glad to help, or even connect you with my ex-colleagues who constitute the cochlear implant team at our University.<br>
I switched departments not too long ago, and worked with them for years.</p>
<p>Feel free to reach out even in private (if the data requires so), but I am available here too.</p>
<p>Best,<br>
Attila</p>
