<p>Dear All,</p>
<p>I am new to Slicer, and I have a trained deep learning model that I need to deploy within the Slicer software. Could someone kindly point me to the relevant documentation or explain the process for integrating and running my model in Slicer?</p>
<p>Any help or guidance would be greatly appreciated!</p>

<p>You can look at examples like MHubRunner, TotalSegmentator, MONAI Auto3DSeg.  Your easiest path would be to adapt your model to work in one of those existing extensions.</p>
