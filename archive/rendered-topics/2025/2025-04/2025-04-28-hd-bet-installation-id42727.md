<p>Please, I am new to 3D Slicer. I am trying to use the HD-BET tool for a project but i can’t find it in the modules of my 3D Slicer application. Can anyone help me install this ?</p>

<p>Hello <a class="mention" href="/u/claudia_takyi">@Claudia_Takyi</a>, the extension isn’t included in Slicer by default but can be accessed from the <code>Extension Manager</code> (ctrl + 4), search for <code>HDBrainExtraction</code>.</p>
