<p>Hello!<br>
For my scientific studies I need to take length and angle measurements on a 3D skull of a patient. I would like to know if you can move a plane parallel to an inferior position without changing the directions of the plane. I need to measure an angle between a line and a plane, but I would like to move the plane so that it crosses the line to create the angle. Is that even possible?<br>
If not, is it possible to lengthen the line so that it crosses the plane without changing its direction?<br>
I would be really happy if you could help me with my questions.</p>
<p>Thank you and best regards!<br>
Sophia</p>
