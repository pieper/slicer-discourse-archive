<p>Greetings,</p>
<p>I installed the SlicerMorph extension which should provide access to the ImageStacks module, but I can’t find it using the Module-finder. I’ve already checked SlicerMorph for updates, is this module not implemented in the current version?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>It shows up on my Slicer. What operating system are you using? Also can you provide a screenshot of your modules? Are there any other SlicerMorph modules missing beyond ImageStacks?</p>

<p>Thanks for the quick reply, I uninstalled and reinstalled SlicerMorph and now have access to ImageStacks.</p>
