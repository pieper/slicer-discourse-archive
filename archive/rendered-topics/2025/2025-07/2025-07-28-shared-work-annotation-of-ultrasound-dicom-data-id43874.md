<p>Hi,<br>
I have a shared dataset (hosted on OneDrive) which i can import and markup/annotate locally but would like to make this visible or accessible to collages who have access to the shared drive.<br>
I have tried a few ways, changing DICOM directory location, saving the scene and files to a separate folder. the latter seems to work but requires us to load in and save out each time overwriting the files in the shared space.<br>
I feel like I’m missing something, has anyone done this differently?</p>
