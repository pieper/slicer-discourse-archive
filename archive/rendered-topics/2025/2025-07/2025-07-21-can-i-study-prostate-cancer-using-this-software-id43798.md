<p>Yes you can. I don’t think you can cite the use of it in a diagnosis, but that’s a legal issue and someone else might chime in. That said, it is a great tool.</p>
<p>I have PCA (low grade, T1c) and after an MP-MRI last year I have been trying all different kinds of open source 3D/DICOM software to get a good look. I had tried Slicer a while back and ran into so many issues that I abandoned it. Lately someone posted that they had good results on a MacBook Pro, which is what have. I decided to give it another go, but this time I had help of my grad student ChatGPT (I’m an Emeritus Engineering Prof, so I no longer have any humans at my beck and call) and he guided me through not only getting MONAI up and running in Slicer, but also getting some fantastic volumes of my gland. So you can definitely study PCa with it.</p>
