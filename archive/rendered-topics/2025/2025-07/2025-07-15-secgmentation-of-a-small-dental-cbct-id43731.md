<p>Operating system: Windows<br>
Slicer version: 5.8.1<br>
Expected behavior: Segment a small volume CBCT of the anterior maxilla i.e divide teeth from bone.<br>
Actual behavior: no 3D image is created, I get an error message:<br>
Failed to load the segmentation.<br>
Something went wrong during the nnUNet processing.<br>
Please check the logs for errors and contact the library maintainers.</p>
<p>Runtime error Reads: CUDA error: no kernal image is available for execution on the device<br>
it goes on to say for debugging consider passing CUDA_LAUNCH_BLOCKING=1</p>
