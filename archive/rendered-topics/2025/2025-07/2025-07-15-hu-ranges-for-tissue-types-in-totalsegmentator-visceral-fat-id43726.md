<p>Hi, I’m using the <em>TotalSegmentator</em> module in 3D Slicer, specifically the <strong>tissue types</strong> segmentation task.<br>
It automatically separates tissues into <strong>visceral fat</strong>, <strong>subcutaneous fat</strong>, <strong>skeletal muscle</strong>, and <strong>intramuscular fat</strong>.<br>
Could you please let me know the Hounsfield Unit (HU) ranges or criteria used for each of these tissue types?<br>
Understanding the HU thresholds would help me better interpret the segmentation results.<br>
Thank you!</p>

<p>doesn’t use HU ranges</p>
