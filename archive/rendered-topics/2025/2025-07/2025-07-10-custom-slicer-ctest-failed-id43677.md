<p>I ran into this issue when I was performing automated tests with ctest<br>
command line：“D:\cmake\bin\ctest.exe” -C Release -V -R “custommodule”<br>
error: [D:/DSI/slicer-build/bin/Release/CustomApp-real.exe] exit abnormally - Report the problem.</p>
<p>Expect someone to tell me how to fix or bypass this b</p>
