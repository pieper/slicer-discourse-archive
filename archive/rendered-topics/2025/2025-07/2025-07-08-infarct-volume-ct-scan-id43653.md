<p>Hi, I’m doing clinical research in neuroradiology and need to measure cerebellar infarct volumes and also posterior cranial fossa, braintem and cerebellum volumes of around 200 patients. I’m doing it with 3D Slicer but it’s taking me a lot of time to mark the structures on every slice, is there any way to authomatize this? Thank you!</p>
