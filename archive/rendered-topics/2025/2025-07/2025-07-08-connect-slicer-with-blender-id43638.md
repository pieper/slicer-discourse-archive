<p>Hello, everyone. I’m new to using Slicer. Right now, I need to design a surgical guide for implant placement, but I can’t link Slicer with Blender. Could anyone please help me?Thanks</p>

<p>There is this thread and tool for a quite old (v4.11) version of slicer. You may want to download those older executables and give it a try:</p><aside class="onebox githubrepo" data-onebox-src="https://github.com/dentsoft-foundation/openPlan">

  <blockquote>
    I use Blender for animations and print-resolution renderings. Right now my workflow is to segment, create models, export as PLY, import to blender, surface, and render. I’ve thought that the segment → blender step is currently a bottleneck (for me, at least); it would be nice to have some way of passing models easily to Blender. 
Just a thought.
