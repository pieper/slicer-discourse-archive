<p>I’m planning to write a research paper that uses the <em>tissue types</em> task of the <strong>TotalSegmentator</strong> module in 3D Slicer to perform <strong>automated body composition segmentation</strong>, particularly focusing on structures such as visceral fat, subcutaneous fat, and skeletal muscle.</p>
<p>Before proceeding further, I’d like to know whether there is <strong>sufficient peer-reviewed evidence</strong> supporting the <strong>accuracy and reliability</strong> of this function for research purposes. Specifically, I’m looking for studies or validation papers that have used this feature (or a closely related method within TotalSegmentator) in <strong>clinical or epidemiological body composition analysis</strong>.</p>
<p>If anyone knows of any published articles, preprints, validation datasets, or even informal benchmarks that could support the scientific use of this segmentation approach, I would greatly appreciate it if you could share them.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for your help!</p>

<p>I don’t use TotalSegmentator in my research, so I don’t know if there are such studies. However, I would say that as a researcher <strong>it is really your responsibility</strong> to make sure that the tool fits your needs. Even if there are studies along those lines, they might have a far more different definition of accuracy and reliability. So citing them is not going to help you.</p>
<p>You can probably segment a few structures on your own, do the same the with total segmentator and decide for yourself using statistics…</p>

<p>Hello Seok_Jin_Hong, I’m also looking to write a paper using total segmentator and I’m kinda in the same boat facing the same issue … how are you going with your project now?</p>
