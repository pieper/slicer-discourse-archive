<p>You can check Embodi3D or TCIA.</p>

<p>There was an extension called <strong>SlicerDataStore</strong>, which offered several atlases, including a knee atlas, but it is not available anymore. I cannot find its successor, and I don’t remember what happened to it. I probably should know this, but there have been so many modules… Maybe someone who reads it can help.</p>
<p>Update: I’d check here, maybe the knee atlas has been uploaded <a href="https://github.com/Slicer/SlicerDataStore" class="inline-onebox">GitHub - Slicer/SlicerDataStore: This project organizes Slicer sample data, atlases and registration case library images.</a></p>
