<p>Hello, I’m fairly new to using 3D Slicer, so I’m finding it a bit challenging. First, in 3D Slicer, which button should I press to reset any rotations or WW/WL adjustments I’ve made? Also, when I adjust the Slice Plane and it becomes rotated, I’d like to realign it to be perfectly horizontal or vertical, but I can’t find the Reset button or the Slice Plane reset button. I would appreciate it if you could tell me how to do this.</p>
