<p>Hello</p>
<p>I am trying to work with some echographics images. I use the draw tool to show the interest area, I export as new labelmap and saving the segmentation file as whatever_seg.nii.gz. However if I open that file, I do not see my drawings marked. I do not not know if I am doing something wrong here</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
