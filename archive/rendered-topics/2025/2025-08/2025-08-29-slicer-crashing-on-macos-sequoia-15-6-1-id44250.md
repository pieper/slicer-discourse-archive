<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I am working on a relatively simple project taking some measurements on MRIs. I have an M3 processor running MacOS Sequoia 15.6.1 with 18GB of memory. I am running Slicer 5.8.1.</p>
<p>It was working fine for months, but the last week, it has crashed on me probably a dozen times when trying to take measurements.  I have tried ensuring I have the latest MacOS, uninstalling and re-installing slicer.</p>
<p>I do not get an error message.  Just the color wheel of death follow by “Slicer is not responding”</p>
<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated,</p>
<p>Joseph</p>

<p>Do you have this with one specific data set? Can you reproduce the issue with the latest Slicer Preview Release?</p>

<p>Multiple datasets.  Not just one.  I am trying now an old stable version 5.6.2</p>
<p>I have not tried the latest Preview release</p>

<p>Thanks for the information. Please try the latest Slicer Preview Release and let us know if you have issues with that.</p>

<p>If the issue is still happening with the preview build, please try to remember the steps you were performing when the issue occurs.</p>
<p>Also, on mac you can use the Activity Monitor with the Sample Process option to get a sense of what the application is actually doing.</p>
<p>FWIW, I use 5.8.1 and the various preview builds all the time on an arm mac without issues like this.</p>
