<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am trying to package my extension for distribution.</p>
<p>I created a release folder and built the extension using <code>make package</code>. It gave me one tar file. But when I extract it I am not seeing any executable. I installed the extension via install from file in extension wizard by selecting the tar file. And I don’t know if it is the correct procedure. After installing and restarting slicer, I am not seeing my extension when I search for it. But it’s there in the extension wizard. If I click it nothing happens.</p>
<p>The extracted tar file’s folder contains only these three folders</p>
<p>include, lib and share</p>
<p>None of them contains any executable.</p>
<p>Any help appreciated.</p>
