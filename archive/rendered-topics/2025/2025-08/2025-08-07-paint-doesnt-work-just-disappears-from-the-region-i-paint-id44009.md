<p>Hi I am new to 3D slicer, I am trying to paint on my CT scan to do a segmentation. After I select the region to paint it doesn’t stay. May I know how to fix this issue.</p>

<p>For future reference, here are the things to check when painting is prevented in a certain area: <a href="https://slicer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/modules/segmenteditor.html#cannot-paint-outside-some-boundaries" class="inline-onebox">Segment editor — 3D Slicer documentation</a></p>
