<p>I’m exploring ways to visualize 3D Slicer models in AR using either the Magic Leap 2 or Lynx R1, but I’m unsure about compatibility as they both support OpenXR but with the runtime locally on the device. Is it possible to stream Slicer’s VR output to those headsets or are there workarounds to make Slicer VR work on either headset?</p>
<p>OS: Windows 11<br>
3D Slicer version: 5.8.1<br>
Headsets: MagicLeap2 (OS1.12.0) / Lynx R1</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>
