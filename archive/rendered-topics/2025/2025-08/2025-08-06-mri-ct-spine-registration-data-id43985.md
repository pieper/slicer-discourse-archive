<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>It seems as though the SpineWeb Dataset is no longer accessible via its online link (<a href="http://spineweb.cigitalimaginggroup.ca/spineweb/index.php?n=Main.Datasets" title="http://spineweb.cigitalimaginggroup.ca/spineweb/index.php?n=Main.Datasets" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">http://spineweb.cigitalimaginggroup.ca/spineweb/index.php?n=Main.Datasets</a>).</p>
<p>Would anyone know of any other MRI-CT spine data that could serve as ground truth for registration?</p>
