<p>The Windows dashboard server (<code>bluestreak</code>) will be temporarily unavailable this afternoon for a scheduled system upgrade by the Kitware team.</p>
<p>We expect the system to be back online later this evening. However, please note that the latest Preview Slicer application and extension packages may not be available tomorrow (August 27th).</p>
<p>If you have any questions or concerns, please don’t hesitate to reach out.</p>

<p>Windows 10 22H2 (19045) will be updated to a Windows 11 version (24H2)? This question considering the end-of-servicing with no free security updates for non-LTSC versions beginning October 14th, 2025.</p>

<p>The system has been upgraded to Windows 11 (23H2), we will circle back in a few days regarding an upgrade to Windows 11 (24H2)</p>
<p>In the meantime, regular upload of Preview and Stable packages should be expected.</p>
