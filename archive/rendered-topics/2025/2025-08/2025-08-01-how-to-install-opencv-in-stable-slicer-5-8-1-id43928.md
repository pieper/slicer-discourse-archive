<p>Hi everyone!</p>
<p>I´m trying to install SlicerOpenCV in new stable release but it is not longer available.</p>
<p>I´ve tryed “slicer.util.pip_install(“opencv-python”)” and “slicer.util.pip_install(“opencv-contrib-python”)“ but I can´t still make “import cv2”</p>
<p>I there any way to do this?</p>
