<p>Hello, im looking to manipulate a 4D torax ultrasound volume (3D + time) with 3D Slicer, i was wondering if there was any plug in necessary in order to do this. Also if anyone knows if it is possible to set coordinates for every point in the surface of the volume it would be really helpful. Thanks.</p>

<p>Have you managed to read the 3D+time ultrasound image into Slicer?</p>

<p>Do you want to get or set coordinates?</p>
