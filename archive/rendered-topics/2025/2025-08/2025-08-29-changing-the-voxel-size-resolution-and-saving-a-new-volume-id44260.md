<p>Hello.<br>
I work with CT scans of jaw bones and teeth. The original volume was recorded with the spacing parameter = 0.2 mm. For me, this is a fairly thick slice and I was looking for ways to improve the quality of segmentation and the model. I found a topic on the forum that this can be done using:<br>
(segment editor - segmentation geometry - oversampling factor).</p>

<p>This works if you do the segmentation manually, and I really get the quality and slice thickness of 0.1 mm that I need.<br>
However, manual segmentation of jaws and teeth is very difficult.</p>
<p>I found the “dental segmentator” extension, which works with a neural network. So, you can load the original volume into the neural network, after which it will automatically perform segmentation.</p>
<p>The problem is that the neural network uses the original volume with spacing = 0.2 mm for calculations, even if I change this parameter in the segment editor.<br>
I think for this to work correctly, you should immediately load a high-quality volume into the neural network.</p>
<p>Is there a way to export a modified volume to Slicer 3D? So, I could change the spacing parameter, and then overwrite the original volume. Having received a new volume, I could load it into the neural network and get the desired result.</p>

<p>You can use the <code>Crop volume</code> module or any of the resampling modules in Slicer to change the voxel size of an image.</p>

<p>If you want some interpolation on the segmentation generated by the dental segmentator, you can export the segmentation as STL and reimport it in your oversampled segmentation from STL model.</p>
<p>The smoothing level of the STL can be controlled directly from the segment editor module.</p>
<p>Best,</p>

<p>Thank you very much for your help and advice!<br>
I want to write a few words about how I solved the problem.<br>
Let my mistakes help other beginners to understand the program faster.<br>
Previously, I did not understand how the volume crop works. I was working on a weak computer. When I set the voxel size too small, it caused the program to freeze.<br>
So, no matter what I did, I could not see the difference between the original segmentation and the segmentation with a potentially higher resolution. As it turned out, I overloaded the computer when forcing it to calculate such a large amount of data.<br>
If I understand correctly, then any change in the original volume leads to an increase in its file size in cube.<br>
In my example:<br>
original volume = 260 MB, spacing = 0.2 mm;<br>
Desired spacing = 0.1 mm, then I need to increase the resolution by 2 times; 2 * 2 * 2 * 260 MB = 2 GB.</p>
<p>Apparently, I simply didn’t have enough RAM (8GB) and the program froze. It was very careless of me that I didn’t think about the low RAM. I realized this when I started working on 16GB of RAM. Then I was able to test all the ways to increase resolutions and interpolation algorithms.<br>
Literally every tenth share of oversampling significantly increases the load on the RAM.<br>
The problem was complicated by the fact that for the neural network to work, it is necessary to load the entire CT - if you crop the volume, for example, leaving only one jaw, the neural network will not be able to segment correctly.</p>
<p>Therefore, I did not use the crop volume. Because of the freezes, it seemed to me that it was useless.</p>
<p>Conclusion: in any case, try to crop the model as much as possible to save RAM and check the RAM in the task manager.</p>
<p>In the crop volume module you can select the desired voxel size by spacing (in the picture)</p>

<p>When using segmentation geometry you can also easily change the voxel size, but be sure to check that you select the correct “newvolumename_cropped” so as not to accidentally freeze your computer and lose the project.</p>
<p>These are simple and obvious conclusions. For high quality, you need more RAM.</p>
<p>I consider that the neural network also spends quite a lot of RAM, so for automated segmentation of all facial bones at once using the dental segmentator with spacing = 0.1 mm, even 16 GB of RAM was not enough for me. Perhaps the problem lies in something else and I have to find a solution to this problem.</p>
