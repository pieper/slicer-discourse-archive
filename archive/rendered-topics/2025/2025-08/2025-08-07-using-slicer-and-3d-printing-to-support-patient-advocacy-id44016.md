<p>I am not a researcher. I am a retired Engineer and used Slicer3D to process a series of CT scans related to a traumatic brain injury and the subsequent cranial surgeries (removal of temporal bone flap, re-attachment of the temporal bone flap, a CSF leak and then replacement of the aseptically resorbing bone flap with a PEEK implant ). The 3d prints were of the bone flap at different stages of degradation (CT series) and were used to in discussions with a medical team on the best follow-up course of action. The question in the meeting was “How viable is the existing bone flap?” Having the degrading bone flap series 3d printed allowed me to demonstrate to the team the extent of the resorption over time; how thick or thin the remaining bone was, the difference in size and thickness compared to the previous CT scan, the progression in sharpness of the edges and the localized erosions that lead to holes through the bone. The prints even showed how one area of the flap was adjacent to an area where the dura was calcifying. I am grateful that this tool exists and is free to use.</p>
