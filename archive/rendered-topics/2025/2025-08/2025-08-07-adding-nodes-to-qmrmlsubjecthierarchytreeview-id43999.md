<p>Hello,</p>
<p>In my custom widget, I have added an empty qMRMLSubjectHierarchyTreeView. I have a class that tracks nodes of a plans. I just need to show those node inside the qMRMLSubjectHierarchyTreeView so that I can get the name, transformation details, Node Id, setting colors features all in one place. Is there any way to add nodes to the tree view without setting it to slicer.mrmlScene and then filtering? If there is no such way without filtering, how can I filter the nodes by ID?</p>
<p>Any help will be apprciated. Thanks in advance.</p>
