<p>Hi Dear Community,</p>
<p>I have developed a module in 3D Slicer for <strong>Brodmann Area overlay</strong> and <strong>MNI space registration</strong>. The module builds successfully, but I’m facing an issue integrating it into my <strong>custom Slicer-based application</strong>.</p>
<p>Has anyone encountered a similar integration issue or can guide me on the proper steps/configuration needed to make the module appear and work correctly in a custom application build?</p>
<p>Any help, suggestions, or references would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance!</p>
