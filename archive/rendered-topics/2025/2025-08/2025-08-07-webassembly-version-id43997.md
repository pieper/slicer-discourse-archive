<p>Hi, I want to know if this library has a WebAssembly version that works with Three.js. If not, would I need to create it myself? And if a WebAssembly version doesn’t exist, how difficult would it be to make one?</p>

<p>That would be a big undertaking that’s not currently available. You may want to look at <a href="http://ohif.org">ohif.org</a> instead.</p>
