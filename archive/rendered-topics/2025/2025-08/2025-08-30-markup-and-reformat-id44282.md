<p>i have made a measurement of fetus head circumference using a markup. I have used “Reformat” to get to the right plane and then I have saved the scene.</p>
<p>When i open the scene and click on the markup, it is taking me to the native plane where the markup is but not to the reformatted plane.</p>
<p>Anyone has any idea how to just click on the markup and directly  go the plane?</p>
