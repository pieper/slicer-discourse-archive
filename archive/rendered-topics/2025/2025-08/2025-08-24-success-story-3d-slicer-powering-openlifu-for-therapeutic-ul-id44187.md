<p>I’m excited to share a recent success story highlighting how <strong>3D Slicer</strong> is being used to accelerate research in therapeutic ultrasound.</p>
<p>Together with <strong>OpenWater</strong>, Kitware customized Slicer to support <strong>OpenLIFU</strong>, an open-source platform that combines hardware and Slicer-driven software for designing and operating therapeutic ultrasound devices. A particular focus of this work is on <strong>wearable ultrasound transducers</strong> that can deliver focused ultrasound into the brain, with the potential to form the basis of new treatments for neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders.</p>
<p>This project showcases how the <strong>open-source nature of Slicer</strong> makes it easier and more affordable to get emerging medical technology into the hands of researchers and product developers worldwide. By lowering barriers and enabling collaboration, Slicer helps bridge the gap between early innovation and impactful clinical applications.</p>
<p>More details are available in this post from Kitware:<br>

<p>It’s inspiring to see how the Slicer ecosystem continues to support the translation of ideas into real-world solutions.</p>
