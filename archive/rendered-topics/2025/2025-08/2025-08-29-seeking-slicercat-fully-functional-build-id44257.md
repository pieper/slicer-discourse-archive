<p>I have built slicercat, but I can only get it to work on Mac OS with python disabled (which means it does not have viewports for images to be displayed and interacted with upon upload). And this is after addressing the plethora of issues that came up with the OS and various files. Is there anyone who has previously built slicercat for mac os that can share that build or expertise on how to set it up?</p>
