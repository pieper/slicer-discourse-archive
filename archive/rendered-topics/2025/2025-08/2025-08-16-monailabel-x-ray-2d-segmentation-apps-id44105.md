<p>I’m currently working on an X-ray segmentation project, aiming to perform semantic segmentation.<br>
My dataset is in <strong>.nii</strong> format and contains 3 different labels. I’ve completed the labeling process and now have around 60 labeled samples.</p>
<p>Of course, the “radiology” application is designed for 3D images, but my data is 2D, so I’ve been trying to adapt and code it accordingly. However, I haven’t been able to get it to run.</p>
<p>My main question is: <strong>Is this even possible?</strong><br>
If it is, I would really appreciate your guidance and support.</p>
