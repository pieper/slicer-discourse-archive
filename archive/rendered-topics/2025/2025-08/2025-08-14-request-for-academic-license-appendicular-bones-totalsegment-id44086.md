<p>Dear 3D Slicer Community,</p>
<p>My name is Juan Carlos Conesa Gallego and I am currently completing my Bachelor’s Thesis in Biomedical Engineering at the Polytechnic University of Cartagena (UPCT), Spain. The project is titled <em>“Optimization of the Design Process of Personalized Anatomical Biomodels for Surgical Planning”</em>.</p>
<p>As part of the workflow, I am using 3D Slicer together with TotalSegmentator for medical image segmentation. For my research, access to the “Appendicular bones” module would be highly beneficial in order to achieve more precise and efficient segmentation results for patient-specific models.</p>
<p>I kindly request an academic (non commercial) license for this module, to be used exclusively within the context of my thesis work. I will be happy to provide any additional information or documentation you may require regarding my academic affiliation or the intended use of the software.</p>
<p>Thank you very much for your time and for making such valuable tools available to the research community.</p>
<p>Kind regards,<br>
Juan Carlos<br>

<p>Hi, I would like access to the same module. Were you able to get it in 3D Slicer? Seems like they only give it as part of the original module. Thank you!</p>
