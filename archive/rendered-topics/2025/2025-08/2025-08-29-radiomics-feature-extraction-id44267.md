<p>Hello. I am using 3D Slicer 5.8.1 for my radiomics study. I already have radiologic images (mri) in nifti format and segmentations in nrrd format. What should I do to extract features using my images and segmentations? I have loaded SlicerRadiomics extension however I can’t find “radiomics” option in the modules. Thanks in advance.</p>
<p>Sincerely</p>

<p>It may not have loaded correctly.  That extension hasn’t had an active maintainer for a while.  You may get ideas reading up previous posts.</p>
