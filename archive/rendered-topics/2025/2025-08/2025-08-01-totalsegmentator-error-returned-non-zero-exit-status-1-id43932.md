<p>Failed to compute results.</p>
<p>Command ‘[‘E:/Slicer 5.8.1/bin/../bin\PythonSlicer.EXE’, ‘E:\Slicer 5.8.1\lib\Python\Scripts\TotalSegmentator.exe’, ‘-i’, ‘C:/Users/msi/AppData/Local/Temp/Slicer/__SlicerTemp__2025-08-01_17+24+27.116/total-segmentator-input.nii’, ‘-o’, ‘C:/Users/msi/AppData/Local/Temp/Slicer/__SlicerTemp__2025-08-01_17+24+27.116/segmentation’, ‘–ml’, ‘–task’, ‘liver_segments_mr’]’ returned non-zero exit status 1 this is the error. Hot to fix this error?</p>

<p>I don’t know what this particular error is all about, but one general advise - I solved a similar problem with TotalSegmentator and many others with the help of ChatGPT / Claude AI…</p>

<p>Try installing the 5.6.2 version. I think this was what solved the issue.</p>
