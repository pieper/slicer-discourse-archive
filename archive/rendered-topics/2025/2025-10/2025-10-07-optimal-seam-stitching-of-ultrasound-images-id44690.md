<p>Combining two partly overlapping ultrasound images in usual ways typically incurs blurring or a noticeable seem. <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=%22ultrasound%22+image+stitching+along+minimum+edge+seam" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Some methods to avoid this</a> have been published. Is there any open source implementation? Ideally implemented in ITK. I think <a class="mention" href="/u/lassoan">@lassoan</a>’s group did some work on this problem, but I can’t find it now.</p>
