<p>im developing module for in python using ai vibe coding .</p>
<p>i had incredibly hard time to create / maintain loadable module . first one was loadable then stopped after some iteration not related to the matter itself . i failed to get it back . tried a second one from scrarch but this time it  shows but not load to slicer . i tried so many iterations so many ways but categorically failed.  im not sure if there is something or the docuemntatoin online accessible to ai is not up to date . i wounder if there is like a dummy loadable module i can use and build on .</p>
<p>thanks</p>

<p>All the loadable modules in Slicer core and most lodmadabke modules in extensions serve as good examples.</p>
<p>It matters a lot which coding agent and IDE you use and how. For me, Visual Studio Code with Claude works quite well. It is rare that it generates non-functional code if you ask the right things.</p>

<p>I’m fairly skilled at prompting and troubleshooting.</p>
<p>I’ve built a few functional apps of medium complexity using Visual Studio Code with multiple AI agents—Claude, Codex, and others.</p>
<p>The best I’ve achieved so far is getting a 3D Slicer module recognized but not actually loaded. It would be great if there were a simple dummy module or a custom instruction set for AI to generate a working module directly.</p>
<p>At this point, the main limitation isn’t technical—it’s just about having the right ideas and a bit of patience to build useful tools. I think there’s massive potential for the community to make 3D Slicer development more accessible to average users like me</p>
<p>I’m not saying I might make the biggest hit , but we might add something very useful .</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>I agree, it can be very productive to use a coding AI tool with Slicer, but it’s also possible to get stuck.  Taking small steps often helps, as does carefully reviewing existing code that works and suggesting the AI use similar methods.</p>

<p>i just found out the the modules works fine when opened in slicer for windows. the issue running things on mac. few tweak and it got loaded on windows version .</p>
<p>im not sure what is the issue and how to get around it .</p>
