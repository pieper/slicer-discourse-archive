<p>Welcome!  If you are looking for images to load while just learning the basics, there is a “Sample Data” module that you can use to easily load various kinds of example images. In the toolbar, click on the magnifying glass icon (or just press Ctrl-F) to bring up the module search window, then type “Sample Data” and open that module.  Click on MRHead (or another example that interests you), and the images will load into the viewers. Slicer has very helpful documentation at <a href="http://slicer.readthedocs.io" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">slicer.readthedocs.io</a>, and I would highly recommend that you read through the Getting Started page at <a href="https://slicer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/getting_started.html" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Getting Started — 3D Slicer documentation</a>.  Once you have gotten familiar with the interface and are trying to do something specific, please feel free to post a new question on this forum.  Also, for an even quicker response, many of the public chatbots handle Slicer questions pretty well, so that can also be a great place to see if you can get an immediate answer to your question.</p>

<p>I suggest you ask ChatGPT or similar Chat for everything. I coded my own Slicer module with ChatGPT with no prior programming knowledge.</p>

<p>im starting some vibe coding web apps and its going well. how does developing a module works in slicer ? any useful link or something ? i can also buid on already existing module and that will be even better</p>

<p>I asked ChatGPT everything. It guided me through step by step. There was a lot of trial and error, be eventually it worked. I use the payed version however.</p>

<p>Been there with the messy back and forth.</p>
<p>What I meant is , is there like a requirement and special code I need to insert to make it compatible with slicer ?</p>
<p>I’m completely naive when it comes to programming or code . So excuse my question if it sounds dumb .</p>

<p>What we’re finding is that “standard” information that has been well documented, like the structure of well known programs like Slicer or the details of programming languages, are the things that the chat programs can organize and present clearly.  So just ask Gemini, Claude, DeepSeek, etc about things where you know the information exists.  When you have complex logic or want to do new things the chat programs are less helpful and even frustrating.</p>

<p>I’m using spec kit with vibe coding . It is helping a lot . Spec kit give the ai very useful structure and help to avoid going crazy later in the project</p>
