<p>Slicer becomes unusable after I connect the extended display<br>
There were no issues using Slicer on my laptop before connecting the external display. After connecting the extended display via HDMI, I dragged the Slicer window onto the extended screen and then closed the software. When I reopened it, it showed a white screen that was unresponsive.</p>
<p>I am using Slicer 5.8.1, and the extended display is a Lenovo B2412Q-R with a resolution of 2560x1440 and a refresh rate of 99.98Hz.</p>
<p>The original screen was the internal display of an Alienware m15R2, with a resolution of 1920x1080 and a refresh rate of 240Hz</p>
<p>I noticed that Display 1 (Alienware m15R2) shows connected to Intel (R) UHD Graphics 630, and Display 2 (B2412Q-R) shows connected to NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060. I don’t know if this makes a difference.<br>
Can anyone help solve my problem?Slicer becomes unusable after I connect the extended display There were no issues using Slicer on my laptop before connecting the external display.
