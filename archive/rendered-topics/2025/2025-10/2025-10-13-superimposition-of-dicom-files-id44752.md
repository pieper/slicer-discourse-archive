<p>This is usually done by using automated or manual registration. For automated you can use Brains (General Registration), for manual you can use the Fiducial Registration. See the Registration part of the user manual for more information: <a href="https://slicer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/registration.html" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Registration — 3D Slicer documentation</a></p>
