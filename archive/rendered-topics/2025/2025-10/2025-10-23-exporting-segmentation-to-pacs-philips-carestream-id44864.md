<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I’d like to export a segmentation from 3D Slicer and import it into our research PACS (Philips/Carestream), so that it can be both visualized as an overlay on CT images and stored there. Has anyone done this before? Which file format and workflow would you recommend, DICOM or something else?</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>
Maria</p>
