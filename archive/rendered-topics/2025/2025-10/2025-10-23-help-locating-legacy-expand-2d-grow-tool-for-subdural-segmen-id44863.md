<p>Hello,</p>
<p>A while ago, I used the legacy Segment Editor in 3D Slicer, which had a tool that allowed me to <strong>expand or grow a segment with a single click</strong>. I don’t remember its exact name, but it worked for segmenting <strong>subdural hematomas</strong>: it would expand the segmentation slice-by-slice in the <strong>axial plane</strong>, stopping at the skull and without oversegmenting.</p>
<p>I have tried to locate this tool in newer versions of 3D Slicer, and even downloaded some older versions, but I cannot find it. It’s <strong>not the Level Tracing tool</strong>, but it looked similar to <strong>Grow from Seeds</strong>, though much simpler and faster.</p>
<p>Can anyone advise:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Whether this tool still exists in recent Slicer versions, or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If there’s a modern equivalent that behaves the same (2D, slice-by-slice, intensity-guided expansion)?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you for your help!</p>
