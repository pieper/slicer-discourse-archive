<p>Hello everyone, I’m having a lot of difficulty segmenting the rib cage and the cartilage of a pediatric patient’s rib cage. This is mainly because the segments are often separated by the sternum, etc., so I can’t effectively use grow seeds.</p>

<p>Grow from seeds should work well. If you have trouble then you can post a few illustrative screenshots.</p>
<p>However, before resorting to semi-automatic segmentation, I would recommend to try MONAIAuto3DSeg and TotalSegmentator extensions that can fully automatically segment costal cartilage and ribs in a few minutes.</p>
