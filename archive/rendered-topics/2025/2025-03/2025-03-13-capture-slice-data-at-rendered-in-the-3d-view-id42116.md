<p>I am looking for a way to save all slice images of the rendered data in the axial axis in the 3D view. I created a new plugin for this. There is a save button. When the button is clicked, I want to save all the rendered data in the 3D view in a sliced ​​form.</p>

<p>Maybe you want to use the Screen Capture module?</p>
