<p>Hi - I’m a completely new to 3D slicer person so any guidance would be helpful. I have a handful of whole body, knee, hip, shoulder, and elbow MRIs (with both T1/T2/PD sequences). I only care about the bones, articular cartilage, ligaments, and tendons at those joints (knee, hip, shoulder, elbow). I would like to build a 3D model based on the these structures (no need for other organs or tissues), and would be very appreciative of any advice on the most streamlined way to do so.</p>
<p>My initial thought is to autosegment first using any of the tools available (MonAI, totalsegmentor, etc.), eliminate the undesired structures, build the 3D model, and then export the CAD/STL files. Does this seen appropriate?</p>
<p>Thank you!<br>
Chris</p>
