<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I’m trying to use <code>Sequence registration</code> for 4D heart CT. For the chambers and blood field it has been working fine to capture the cardiac motion, but I was wondering if the the registration can also capture the shear and torsion, especially during contraction in the ventricular wall.<br>
I also noticed that there are multiple presets, is any of those suitable for torsion registration?</p>
<p>Thank you in advance!</p>
