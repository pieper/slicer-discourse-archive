<p>Operating system: Windows 11<br>
Slicer version: 5.8.1</p>
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>First of all I would like to thank you guys for this app that makes my life so much easier, and also a huge thanks to the TotalSegmentator team!</p>
<p>I am doing a project where I have to segment the liver segments and the spleen.<br>
Is there a way to make my own “selection” of things to segment?<br>
In the total segmentator list I can individually do liver and if I want the spleen too I have to perform the TOTAL segmentation for all organs and this takes more time and processing power.</p>
<p>Is there a way to creaty my own choice of organs called “X” that does liver segments and spleen?</p>
<p>Thank you</p>
