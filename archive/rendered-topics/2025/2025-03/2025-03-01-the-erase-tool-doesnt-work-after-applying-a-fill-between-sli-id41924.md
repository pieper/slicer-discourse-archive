<p>When performing ‘fill between slices’ on a stack of images, I subsequently review to correct. However, the erase tool is not working; I cannot erase to correct. Is there any solution?</p>

<p>While the “Fill between slices” effect is active, you see the preview of the result of filling. You can go to “Fill between slices” effect options, click “Apply” to finish the filling operation, and then you can use all the effects as usual.</p>
