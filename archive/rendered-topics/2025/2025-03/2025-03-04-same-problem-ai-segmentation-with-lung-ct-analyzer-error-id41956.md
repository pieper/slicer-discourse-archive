<p>Hi, I’ve been trying to use the Lung CT Analyzer extension with the AI segmentation ‘lung mask’, but I cannot get it to work.<br>
First,after I put a point in trachea and press apply button,I get a confirmation like:“PyTorch will be downloaded and installed using light-the-torch (ltt install torch torchvision). The process might take some minutes.”<br>
If I press OK, I will get the following error:Failed to compute results: Command ‘[‘D:/Slicer 5.8.1/bin/…/bin\PythonSlicer.EXE’, ‘-m’, ‘pip’, ‘install’, ‘light-the-torch&gt;=0.5’]’ returned non-zero exit status 1.<br>
How can I solve this problem?Thanks in advance!</p>
