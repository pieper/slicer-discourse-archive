<p>Goodevening, I am trying to perform a dental segmentation on a Cone Beam Computed Tomography in order to evaluate the extention of maxillary sinus.<br>
When I try to load the dicom data, the following error appears: " Unnamed Series [Scalar Volume]: Reference image in series does not contain geometry information. Please use caution. "<br>
I have tried to anonymize the dicom file but it doesn’t work.<br>
How can I solve?<br>
Thanks in advance</p>
