<p>Hello!</p>
<p>I would like to ask whether there is a way to constraint the centerline of a tubular shape to only be comprised by one point per slice. If not, is my only option extracting the full centerline and then resample it so that the spacing roughly corresponds to the slice thickness?</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>
