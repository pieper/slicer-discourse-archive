<p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>I am facing a similar issue while working with a custom 3D Slicer application. I followed the SlicerCAT guide to create a custom 3D Slicer template and built it using CMake.</p>
<p>Now, I want to add modules, but I am unsure where to add them and how to proceed. After adding the modules, how should I build the project to see the changes?</p>
<p>Additionally, what is the correct way to open the project folder for editing? Should I use VS Code or Visual Studio?</p>
<p>Any guidance would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!</p>
