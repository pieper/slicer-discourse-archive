<p>Hello<br>
I want to set up server which does automatic slicing with model creation for maxilkary scans after receiving Dicom with manual import. We already have perfected  working workflow to be done manually.</p>
<p>I would be happy to find someone for this work or for helping as tutor. Would pay well for either role.</p>
