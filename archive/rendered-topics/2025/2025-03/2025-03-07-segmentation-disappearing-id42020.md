<p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>Today, while using 3D Slicer version 5.8.0, I utilized the TotalSegmentator to create a model. Despite it initially being visible, the entire segmentation suddenly disappeared from the 3D view as well as from the coronal, axial, and sagittal views of the CT scan I was working with.</p>
<p>Thinking it might be a bug, I upgraded to version 5.8.1, but encountered the same issue multiple times while working on the same dataset. Upon restarting the program and reloading the file, the error persisted or, at times, the segmentation would be missing right from the start.</p>
<p>If I copy some segments to a new segmentation, they initially appear but eventually disappear again. The segments are not deleted, as their names still exist, but they are no longer visible as if they were never there.</p>
<p>Has anyone experienced this issue before and knows what might be causing it?</p>
<p>Thank you all for your attention.</p>

<p>Just adding to the question, i think the file was corrupted somehow.<br>
Created a new model from scratch on 5.8.1 using the same CT scan and it’s been almos 1 hour and did not had the problem anymore.</p>
