<p>The modules <strong>Resample DTI Volume</strong> and <strong>Resample Scalar/Vector/DWI Volume</strong> are under <strong>Diffusion &gt; Utilities</strong> in the Slicer GUI, but are under <strong>Converters</strong> at <a href="https://slicer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/modules/index.html#converters" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Modules — 3D Slicer documentation</a>.<br>
Is that intentional? Am I missing something?</p>

<p>No, I think that’s just a mistake.  It would be great if you want to update the documentation to match the program (make a PR).</p>

<p>I’m sorry, I’ve only ever once tried to do a pull request (for a different project), it was very painful, and I’ve forgotten how I did it. I could create an issue if that would help.</p>

<p>Okay, yes, starting with an issue would be great.</p>
