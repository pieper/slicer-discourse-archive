<p>Hello everyone. Does anyone know about Sina/Mosocam? Where can I download it and how can I integrate it with 3D Slicer?</p>

<p>The technique that you mentioned is described in detail for example here:</p>

<p>It seems that the apps are no longer available - see the comment at the end of the paper:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The old version of Sina has been taken off the shelves, and the latest version can be obtained for free through the following link: <a href="https://h5.clewm.net/?url=qr61.cn%2FoWV3W3%2FqnURKgD&amp;hasredirect=1">https://h5.clewm.net/?url=qr61.cn%2FoWV3W3%2FqnURKgD&amp;hasredirect=1</a>). MosoCam has been removed from the Apple App store at present. Our mobile phones can continue to be used, but those that have not been downloaded before cannot be obtained, but they can be replaced by the re-exposure camera App, which can be obtained free of charge in the Apple App store.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The linked page has a <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/oPsLsfHw21PiAYrt7D2UDw">video</a> that shows how all this works.</p>
<p>To me, it seems that this overlay feature is quite generic, so you can reproduce the workflow by taking a picture of 3D Slicer screen and overlay it on the live camera image using a “double exposure” app (such as “dittoed”, available on Android and Apple).</p>
