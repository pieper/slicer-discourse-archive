<p>I have a couple different incomplete terminologies i have imported during some test that i would like to get rid off. I am not sure where these are saved, since some of these terminologies show in Slicer versions that I just recently installed, so it can’t be in the install tree.</p>
<p>Any pointers will be much appreciated.</p>

<p>Turns out in MacOS it is located in<br>
<code>/Users/amaga/.config/slicer.org/Terminologies</code></p>
