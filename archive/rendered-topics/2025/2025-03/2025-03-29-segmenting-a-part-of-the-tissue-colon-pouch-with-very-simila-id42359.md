<p>I have CT scan of the abdomen, and am trying to segment a “part” of the colon (pouch) along with the staple line, and since the pouch signal intensity very resembles nearby tissue, and using threshold gives lot of noise, so how could we segment a twisted tissue (which does not have a very discrete boundary [if we use threshold], and twisted in 3D) easily?</p>
