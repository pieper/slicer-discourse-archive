<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am working on segmenting bone marrow from CT images and I am interested in using TotalSegmentator for this task. Ideally, I would like to find a model for bone marrow segmentation. However, if there is no specific model for bone marrow, I would appreciate any help with bone segmentation instead.</p>
<p>Could you provide guidance on the following:</p>
<p>-Does TotalSegmentator have a model for bone marrow segmentation in CT scans?<br>
-If not, could you recommend the best model or configuration for bone segmentation?<br>
-Are there any specific settings or parameters that I should adjust to improve the segmentation of bone marrow or bone?<br>
-Are there any additional resources or tips for achieving better segmentation results for bone marrow or bone with TotalSegmentator?<br>
Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated!</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>
