<p>It is straightforward to display any robotic device in Slicer, both in 3D and 2D views. There are many examples, both rigid articulated robots and flexible guided catheters. You can have a look <a href="https://discourse.slicer.org/search?q=robot">at robotics related posts on this forum</a> and ask any specific questions here.</p>
