<p>Operating system: Windows 11<br>
Slicer version: 5.6.2<br>
I am having issues with the Engraving tool on the “SegmentEditorExtraEffects” extension. When I make the engraving or embossing, and then hit “apply” the engraving/embossing does not apply to my 3D rendering. Im pretty new to this, and doing for a fairly novel college course, any help would be greatly appreciated!</p>
