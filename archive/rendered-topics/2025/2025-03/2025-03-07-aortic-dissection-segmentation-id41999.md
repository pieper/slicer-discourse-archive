<p>Hello, I am new to the segmentation world, and want to see how well slicer could be used in acute settings for aortic dissections. I was wondering what is the best way to show the false lumen/true lumen.</p>
<p>For example, my centre wishes to use it in Type A dissections to determine If the dissection invades the aortic root, or the branches of the aorta. How could I best show this?</p>
<p>I also was wondering what segmentation could be done for intracardiac conditions like myxomas. Any help would be great as someone just getting started. Advice would also be appreciated!!</p>

<p>I don’t think there are any dissection-specific methods, but you should be able to use standard segmentation and visualization features of Slicer for these kinds of problems.  Probably you should just start with the tutorials and see what you can apply to your data.  If you run into specific issue or questions, please try to replicate them on data you can share publicly and someone can probably give you advice.</p>
