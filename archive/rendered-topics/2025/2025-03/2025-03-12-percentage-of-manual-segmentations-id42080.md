<p>Is there a way to get the percentage of manual segmentations with the “paint” or “draw” option in the Segment Editor Module after using the “fill between slices”? I’m working on a reliability study and the goal is to manually segment 10% of the images and was wondering if that percentage could be exported.</p>
