<p>Hello, I am interested in generating a heat map to visualize changes in certain structures (preoperation and postoperation) using registered cbct files (nii.gz).</p>
<p>I tried model to model distance extension but it didn’t work, converting nii.gz to .vtk through slicer didn’t work either. I also have the files with the corresponding landmarks for both timepoints.</p>
