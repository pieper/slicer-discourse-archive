<p>I have used the following commands from the blog *SlicerCAT: Creating custom applications based on 3D Slicer:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">pip install cookiecutter jinja2-github
cookiecutter gh:KitwareMedical/SlicerCustomAppTemplate
</code></pre>
<p>After creating the custom template, I only changed the resource folder in the application (specifically the images) and then built it using CMake gui. Now, I can see my logo.<br>
In my custom template module, there is only one home module. How can I add another module? Additionally, I need proper guidance on how to add or remove custom modules in the <code>Modules</code> folder.<br>
then after making the changes how i can build them again to  see my changes and how plz any one</p>
