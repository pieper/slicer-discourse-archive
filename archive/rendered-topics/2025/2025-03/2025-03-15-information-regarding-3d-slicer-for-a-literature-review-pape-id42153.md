<p>Hey,</p>
<p>I am writing a systematic review paper about body composition analysis (BCA) software tools for CT and MRI. The review is going to be published in a peer reviewed journal paper in addition to being a part of my bachelor’s thesis at Aalto University, Finland. The study plan is registered to PROSPERO (CRD420250651100).</p>
<p>The aim is to compare software tools for BCA, regarding accessibility (open access vs commercial), automation of segmentation, output variables (SMM, PMM, SAT, VAT, IMAT, etc.).</p>
<p>I would need answers to a few short questions:</p>
<p>Software name<br>
Website for download<br>
Creator/Copyright holder	<br>
Open-source (yes/no)<br>
License (open access or commercial)<br>
Price (if applicaple)	Coding language<br>
Degree of automation of segmentation (manual, semiautomatic, or automatic)	Allows training with the user’s own data (yes/no)<br>
AI models used (U-Net etc.)<br>
CT or MRI<br>
2D or 3D segmentation<br>
Available for clinical use<br>
CE-marked (yes/no)<br>
FDA approved (yes/no)<br>
Specs requirements (OS, CPU, GPU, RAM etc)<br>
Downloadable or web application<br>
DOI (for article of software)</p>
