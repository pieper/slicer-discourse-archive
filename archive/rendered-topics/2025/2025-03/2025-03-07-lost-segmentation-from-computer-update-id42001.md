<p>Hi everyone,<br>
After my computer installed a software update last night, I opened 3D Slicer this morning and found that none of my segmentation data had been saved. This data represents weeks of work, so I’m hoping there’s a way to recover it.<br>
Has anyone experienced this before, and is there a method to retrieve lost segmentation files? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.<br>
Thank you!</p>

<p>If you saved your segmentations (to .seg.nrrd files) then you can always load them into Slicer. Do you have those segmentation files?</p>

<p>Unfortunately not! Is there any other way to retrieve them when the files haven’t been saved please?</p>

<p>You have not saved any files for several weeks? Or you saved the scene but you cannot find the files?</p>
