<p>I would like to inquire about measuring the cross-sectional area of segments in 3D Slicer. I am currently using version 5.8.1. However, I was unable to locate the “Segment Cross-Section Area” module in the Extension Manager.</p>
<p>Could you please advise on how to proceed in this case?</p>

<p>The module is provided by the <code>Sandbox</code> extension. There are more advanced version of the module in <a href="https://github.com/vmtk/SlicerExtension-VMTK?tab=readme-ov-file#the-vmtk-extension-for-3d-slicer">VMTK extension</a>.</p>
