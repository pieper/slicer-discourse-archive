<p>Hello, I’m looking for guidance on how to assess myosteatosis using CT imaging at the L3 level.</p>
<p>Recently, we came across the IMAC (Intramuscular Adiposity Content) index, which is defined as the ratio between the mean Hounsfield Unit (HU) value of the multifidus muscle and the mean HU value of subcutaneous fat. The idea is that this ratio helps normalize for technical variations in the scan.</p>
<p>However, most papers do not clearly specify how to best define the regions of interest (ROIs) for these measurements. Some studies analyze the entire multifidus muscle, while others focus on smaller, selected areas within the muscle. The same goes for the subcutaneous fat.</p>
<p>Could anyone clarify the best practices or recommendations for ROI selection in this context?</p>
<p>Best,<br>
Marcelo</p>
