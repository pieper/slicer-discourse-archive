<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>It seems that PR <code>ENH: Add Curved Planar Reformation (CPR) support to GeneralizedReformat #8148</code> was recently merged.</p>
<p><strong>Based on this, I’m wondering if it would be feasible to work on creating dedicated CPR slice view for dental panoramic visualization.</strong></p>
<p>Even if completing the full implementation isn’t possible within the week, learning about the overall approach and best practices would already be incredibly helpful to me. Would anyone be interested in this topic?</p>
<p>As this is my first Project Week, I may not be the best person to lead the effort, but I would be very happy to contribute and learn from those with more experience.</p>

<p>Hi Park,</p>
<p>It would be nice to know more about what you have in mind. I suggest you create a project draft (instructions <a href="https://projectweek.na-mic.org/PW43_2025_Montreal/ContributingProjectPages.html" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">here</a>). We can then discuss your project during the next preparation meeting tomorrow (May 27). It will also be an opportunity to introduce yourself to the community and find potential collaborators.</p>
