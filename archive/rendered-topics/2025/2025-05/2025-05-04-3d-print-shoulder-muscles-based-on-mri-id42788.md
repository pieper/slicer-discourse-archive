<p><strong>Hi everyone, I’m a beginner and I need some help <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/blush.png?v=14" title=":blush:" class="emoji" alt=":blush:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></strong></p>
<p>I’m working on a student project where I need to <strong>3D print shoulder muscles based on MRI DICOM images</strong>, specifically focusing on the <strong>rotator cuff</strong> with three common pathologies:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tendinopathy of the supraspinatus</strong></li>
<li><strong>Subacromial bursitis</strong></li>
<li><strong>Supraspinatus tendon tear</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>I would like to know:</p>
<ul>
<li>Has anyone already printed <strong>muscle anatomy from MRI</strong> (not CT), particularly using <strong>3D Slicer</strong> or <strong>TotalSegmentator</strong>?</li>
<li>Can you share any tips, workflows or examples?</li>
<li>Is it possible to segment those shoulder muscles and export to STL for 3D printing?</li>
</ul>
<p>I’m quite new to this, so any beginner-friendly explanation or guidance would be very appreciated. Thank you so much in advance!</p>
