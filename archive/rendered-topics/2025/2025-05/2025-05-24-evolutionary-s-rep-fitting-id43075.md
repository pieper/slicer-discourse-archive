<p>Is it possible to batch this with a csv file?  Or does it need to be done in python?</p>

<p>What kind of information do you have in the csv file?</p>
<p>We provide a lot of batch options to run modules like this one, including <a href="https://www.kitware.com/introducing-slicerpipelines-a-coding-free-way-to-create-simple-modules-in-3d-slicer/">https://www.kitware.com/introducing-slicerpipelines-a-coding-free-way-to-create-simple-modules-in-3d-slicer/</a></p>

<p>Would like to run on a batch of stl files.  Other SALT modules have a csv option.  Wondering if I just do not see it.  Never used pipelines, But I believe that it would take python scripting to add the functionality.   Probably easier to just script the execution over a bunch of files.</p>

<p>Just confirming that to run many files, Option 1. Manual 2. Develop code for pipeline or 3. python script</p>

<p>Is the evoluntionary s-rep an option in the pipeline?  Or is it the old s-rep method?</p>
