<p>Problem report for Slicer 5.8.1 win-amd64:</p>
<p>In settings-&gt;view I have unchecked the “Show slice edge in 3d” checkbox but after restarting the red, green and yellow rectangular outlines are still shown in the 3d view.</p>
<p>it seems like this checkbox should also be available in the “Toggle visibility of elements in the 3D view” .</p>
<p>Thanks for the help.</p>

<p>Are you loading a scene from an earlier version of Slicer?  This behavior is reported, but not actually solved, here: <a href="https://discourse.slicer.org/t/hide-slice-rectangles-in-3d-view/42912/6" class="inline-onebox">Hide slice rectangles in 3D view - #6 by mikebind</a></p>
