<p>Is there any video related function? If there is no solution, you can import the video signal or local video file into the software, overlay the 3D model with the video for display, and choose to hide the video; Fusion display of 3D model and video screen, lock the relative position of model and video, highlight the junction of model and video, and adjust the image position back and forth and reset the image position.</p>
