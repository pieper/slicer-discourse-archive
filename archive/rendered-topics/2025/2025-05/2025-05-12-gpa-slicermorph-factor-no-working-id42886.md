<p>In preview versions (and going forward with the stable as well), the covariate description has been moved to the data input panel (the first tab). You need to specify your factor labels, and then fill them in the csv file template created for you.</p>
<p>See the updated instructions here; <a href="https://github.com/SlicerMorph/Tutorials/tree/main/GPA_1" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Tutorials/GPA_1 at main · SlicerMorph/Tutorials · GitHub</a></p>
