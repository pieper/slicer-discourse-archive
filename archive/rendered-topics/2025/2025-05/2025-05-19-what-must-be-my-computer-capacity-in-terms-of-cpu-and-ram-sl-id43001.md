<p>Hello,<br>
I have downloaded the latest version of Slicer 3D, in my DELL Laptop. The application is running so slow that I can not create 3D images. Could you please advise how much CPU and RAM I would need to operate 3D Slicer on my laptop?</p>
<p>Many Thanks</p>

<p>this depends on your dataset. What ttype of dataset are you trying to use, and what are the specs of your dell laptop.</p>

<p>Unfortunately you are using an old computer. That CPU is end of life for 4 years now (it was released more than 10 years ago).  This is directly from Slicer h/w requirements:</p>
<p><code>3D Slicer runs on any Windows, Mac, or Linux computer that was released in the last 5 years. Older computers may work (depending mainly on graphics capabilities).</code></p>
<p>You will need a newer computer, or may consider running things on the cloud. See <a href="https://slicer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/getting_started.html#system-requirements" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Getting Started — 3D Slicer documentation</a></p>
