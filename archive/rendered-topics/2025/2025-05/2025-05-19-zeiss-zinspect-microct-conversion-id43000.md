<p>Dear Slicer Community,</p>
<p>Does anyone know of any workflows, tools or extensions that would allow the conversion of a ZEISS .zinspect microCT study to be converted to a format readable by Slicer3D or other imaging softwares?</p>

<p>In general, if you know the dimensions of the image volume, data type, you should be able to import your data into Slicer by creating a custom NHDR header. Is the .zinspect file human readable, does it contain information about image geometry? Is there a separate image/volume file.</p>

<p>Thanks for your response Murat. I am unsure to be honest. Would you be open to me sharing the .zinspect file with you to assess that? Happy to pay for any time spent.</p>

<p>I cannot guarantee I can look, but if you cna share publicly you would have more chance someone giving you pointers.</p>
