<p>Hi, I’m a patient and I want to take my CT scan result for doctor review. However when I download the CT scan result, it is unlike a “common” Dicom file I knew and it has two layer of it. Could you guys please guide me how can I covert them to the picture on the left.</p>

<p>Did you forget attaching an image? From this information I don’t think anyone could help, but please upload a picture (without personal information) and we’ll take a look. Also if you show what the file looks like (how many files, extension, etc.) that will be useful as well. Thanks!</p>
