<p>I know that 3D glasses are no longer widely used, but there are several newer glasses-free displays that have recently been released that would make good use of those extensions if there was a way to update them for newer GPU hardware.  I’m currently using an Acer Spatial Labs Pro monitor and the fidelity of 3D models or anything rendered is excellent.   Since the display is OpenXR compatible I’ve been able to export the 3D view in Slicer to the display with ok results.  The problem has to do with the difference between these displays and the VR headsets.</p>
<p>In the spatial display the object stays static and the perspective is altered based on the position of your eyes, whereas in VR your head is the focal point and the objects move in space based on what direction you turn your head.  This results in a lot of movement of the volume rendering/model when you head changes position relative to the screen.  Also the objects are harder to manipulate, since you aren’t using VR controllers when viewing the object. I’m not quite sure where to begin when it comes to modifying this, so any help would be appreciated.</p>
<p>I appreciate all the hard work and effort that you all have put into this software.  It has really broadened my scope of practice and helped me to plan for some really complex procedures.  I don’t know much about programming other than what ChatGPT tells me, but it’s enough to for me to understand the amount of work it must have taken to keep this platform going for so long.</p>
