<p>I still use flood fill as a segmentation tool.  it seems that the ability to pan by holding down the shift key is not enabled. Clicking on a slice with the shift down elicits the flood fill rather than allowing me to shift the slice one way or another.  It would be great to have that pan functionality. I am on an m4 macbook pro running sequia and the build of slicer from yesterday.</p>
