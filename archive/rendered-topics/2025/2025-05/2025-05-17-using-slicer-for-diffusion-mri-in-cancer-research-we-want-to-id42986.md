<p>Not using it, but would love to. Why someone does not write a simple, fully automatic analyzer for the results of an MP-MRI of the Prostate is anybodies guess. Doesn’t need to do anything with tumors, just segmentation, volumetric results, and anomaly highlights with all sorts of disclaimers to protect the author.</p>
