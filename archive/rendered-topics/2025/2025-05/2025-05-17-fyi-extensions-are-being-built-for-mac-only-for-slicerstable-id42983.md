<p>Since a few weeks, extensions were not being built for Linux (SlicerStable). Since today, they are built for Mac only.</p>
<p>Moreover, for SlicerVMTK in particular, the build fails seemingly due to <a href="https://slicer.cdash.org/viewBuildError.php?buildid=3796979" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">corrupt files</a> retrieved from remote.</p>
<p>Just informing for maintainers to have a look.</p>
