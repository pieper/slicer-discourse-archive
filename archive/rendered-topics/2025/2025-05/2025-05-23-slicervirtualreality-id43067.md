<p>Hello! Does anyone know how I can install the Slicer VR module? I’m currently using version 5.7.0-2024-09-03, and it doesn’t appear in the extensions manager. Should I update to the latest version, or is there a way to install it independently of the extensions manager?</p>
<p>Thank you very much in advance.</p>

<p>The SlicerVR extension unfortunately comes and goes. For example for the current nightly it does not build (see <a href="https://github.com/KitwareMedical/SlicerVirtualReality/issues/183#issuecomment-2864150012">here</a>). It is possible that for the nightly you use it is also not available. The community makes a real effort to make sure everything works in the stable versions, while the preview versions are not that reliable.</p>
<p>The dashboard shows that the current stable (5.8.1) has a valid SlicerVR, so I’d start there.</p>
