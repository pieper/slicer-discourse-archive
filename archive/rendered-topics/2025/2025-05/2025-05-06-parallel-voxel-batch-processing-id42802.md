<p>Hello! I am trying to perform voxel-based radiomic feature extraction (GLCM features) for a single 3D prostrate cancer image. I am trying to speed up and also parallelize feature extraction of voxels. But instead of working on an entire group of pixels that belong to the image, I am interested in extracting the features from voxels in batches, because currently I think features are extracted only one voxel at a time. Is there a way by which both parallel extraction of features and extraction of features while batching the voxels can be achieved?</p>
