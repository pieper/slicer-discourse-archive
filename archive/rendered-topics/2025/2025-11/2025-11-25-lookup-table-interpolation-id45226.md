<p>I’m generating new Lookup Tables to look at volumes with logarithmic scales. The lookup table I’m creating has a certain number of colors that determine the value resolution in the volumes we are visualizing with this lookup table. I noticed the Interpolation option on the bottom of the Lookup Table in the Volume Module. I want to now if this interpolation is refearing to the values in the lookup table or between voxels in the image. Also, what type of interpolation is used?</p>
