<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I need to use 3D slicer to create ECV map, but when I try to import DICOM files (on a CD), and use the T1 ECV Mapping extension, I can’t find and upload the imput volumes!! Do I need the internet to do so? Or is there another problem with the extension?</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Nawel</p>
