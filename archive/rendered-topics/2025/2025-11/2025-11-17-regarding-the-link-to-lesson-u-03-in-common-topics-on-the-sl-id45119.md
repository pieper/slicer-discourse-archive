<p>On the SlicerIGT tutorial page, the link for lesson U-03 in the “Common Topics” section is broken and I cannot open it. I wanted to connect the NDI Aurora Sensor to 3D Slicer using the Plus Toolkit and import the positional information measured by Aurora in 3D Slicer, but I do not know how to connect it and am having trouble. Could anyone please fix this as soon as possible?</p>

<p>I was just able to access this via the link at <a href="https://www.slicerigt.org/wp/user-tutorials/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">User tutorials | SlicerIGT</a>.  Does that work for you?</p>

<p>Hi mikebind!</p>
<p>I have already tried that link, and it did work. I appreciate you for your advice.</p>
<p>So this post is turning into a warning that the “U-03” link on the tutorial page is broken.</p>
