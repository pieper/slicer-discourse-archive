<p>Hi all!</p>
<p>I just downloaded 3D Slicer on my Laptop, however the formatting is really weird. The icons and font size are huge, also whenever I open the program it is also huge and I have to scroll to reach the “full screen” icon, which just cramps everything together and barely makes it usable.</p>
<p>I have been able to change the font size, however I do not know how to fix the rest, such as the icon sizes and the size of the window whenever I start the program.</p>
<p>Does anyone know how to fix that?</p>
<p>Thanks a lot in advance!</p>

<p>Can you provide a bit more information about your setup? The issue you’re describing often depends on display settings. Specifically, it would help to know:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Which operating system are you using (Windows, macOS, Linux)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What version of 3D Slicer</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your laptop’s screen resolution</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your display scaling (e.g., 100%, 150%, 200%)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whether you are using an external monitor</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>With that info, we can narrow down the cause and find the right fix</p>

<p>Hi, just managed to figure it out, it was the display scaling! It was automatically set to 150%, after I changed that to 100% it worked normally. Thanks a lot anyways:)</p>

<p>At least please confirm that you are using Windows and let us know the version of Slicer you use.</p>
<p>Although the primary goal of each topic is to help the poster, the topics are also supposed help others, and for that we need to understand the issue better. Thanks!</p>
