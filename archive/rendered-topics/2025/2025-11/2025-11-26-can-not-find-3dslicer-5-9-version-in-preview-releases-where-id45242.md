<p>I can not find 3DSlicer 5.9 version to download. Preview releases ends up on 5.8.1 version. There’s missing 5.9, where is it available?</p>
<p>Thank you in advance.</p>

<p>If you click on the “access older releases” it should take you there, but it looks like that hasn’t been updated since 5.8.1</p>

<p>You can see there are mostly even-minor-version releases there.</p>

(give it a second to display all the folders)</p>
<p>So 5.6, 5.8, 5.10 etc.</p>
<p>5.7 is not a stable release but rather just what we call the nightly releases between 5.6 and 5.8</p>
<p>Similarly “5.9” refers nightly releases that occur after 5.8 was released but before 5.10 was.</p>
<p>Similarly you can see the current preview release is called “5.11.0”: <a href="https://download.slicer.org/">https://download.slicer.org/</a></p>
<p>So there is no one 5.9 release, just many revisions between 5.8 (rev 33241) and 5.10 (rev 34045) that all were at some point called “5.9”. (<a class="mention" href="/u/jcfr">@jcfr</a> please correct me if I got this wrong)</p>
<p>I don’t know that we keep any nightly builds archived permanently. If know the revision number you want, it might be found in the drafts folder <a href="https://slicer-packages.kitware.com/#collection/5f4474d0e1d8c75dfc70547e/folder/5f4474d0e1d8c75dfc705484" class="inline-onebox">SPKC</a><br>
There are various “5.9” revisions in there</p>
