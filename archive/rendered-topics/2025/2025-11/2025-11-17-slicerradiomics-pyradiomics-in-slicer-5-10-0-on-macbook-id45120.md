<p>Hii</p>
<p>I just downloaded Slicer 5.10.0. on my Macbook. I wanted to use the SlicerRadiomics/Pyradiomics extension but I couldn’t find it. Is there any chance that I could use the extension on my Mac?</p>
<p>does it exist? or should i download previous stable release and which one?</p>
<p>thank you!!</p>
