<p>I’m running into a problem getting the MusculoskeletalAnalysis extension to work. I’m able to go through the tutorial on the extension website with the provided sample data successfully. As a next test, I tried using the sample image data and creating my own segmentation. The analysis then fails to complete, with the error in the log showing as “Can only export 1 or 3 component images, current image has 0 components” despite the segment being essentially the same visually as the provided sample segment. This happens for both cortical and cancellous bone test cases.</p>
<p>Do the mask segments need to be formatted in a specific way?</p>
