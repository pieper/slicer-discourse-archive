<p>Is it possible to build an extension package and add it to the Extension Manager to be publicly available for installation? I currently have a developed module that is locally integrated or can be integrated via cloning the Git repo.</p>
<p>As well, are there suggestions about where to publish a brief overview of the open-source code, i.e. The Journal of Open Source or arxiv?</p>

<p>Yes! Start here with the instructions for distributing an extension by getting it added to the extensions index: <a href="https://slicer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer_guide/extensions.html#distribute-an-extension" class="inline-onebox">Extensions — 3D Slicer documentation</a></p>
