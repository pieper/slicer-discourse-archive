<p>Hi, I need to create planes from points. Is that possible?<br>
If I have two points, I understand that I need a third coordinate to define a plane, so  I would like to orient that plane along an X, Y, or Z direction, (for example: R Condylar Point - Right Gonion - sagittal)</p>
<p>I need these planes to use them as reference planes for measurements and also for clipping.<br>
Is that also possible?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
