<p>In the pedicle screw planner module, I am unable to load a screw or visualize a screwafter placing markers. Directly getting a tab to adjust screw but no screw is visible.</p>
<p>In the pedicle screw simulator module, is it possible to have screw sizes (Length and width) that we can manually enter and not as a drop down box. Alternatively if it must be drop down box, may I suggest that the screw length start from 25mm and proceed in increments of 5 till 60mm. The width may begin @ 4.0mm and proceed increment of 0.5mm till 7.5mm. The will be appropriate for thoracic and lumbar pedicle screw implants currently used at these levels. (Cervical implants are smaller)</p>
