<p>I cannot delete any patients? I am writing clicking and delete and it doesn’t get rid of the patient nor does clicking remove all data sets. Please can someone advise?</p>

<p>Delete works for me on latest stable (5.10.0) on Mac. What operating system are you on, and what version of Slicer are you using.</p>
<p>Also can confirm you actually have write access to the location where the dicom database is located? E.g. can you actually add a new dicom?</p>
