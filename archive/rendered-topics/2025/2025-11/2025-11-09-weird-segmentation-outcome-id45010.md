<p>Hi there, I’m using total segmentator to segment abdominal muscle (tissue 4 type) + some manual correction/painting of the muscles (using paint function with a set HU range -29 to 150) that are not included in the segmentation subtask such as TA or intercostal muscles. However I’ve been noticing really weird HU outcomes for example I’ve got at lowest 15HU on average for muscles which doesn’t seem right to me. I know that sometimes CT acquisition parameters could change HU and volumetric outcomes, but am I missing something else here? Would appreciate some help from someone who might have done this before <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/smiling_face_with_tear.png?v=15" title=":smiling_face_with_tear:" class="emoji" alt=":smiling_face_with_tear:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>
