<p>Hello everyone,<br>
I am Dr.RUPEN RAJVIR , BHMS, currently in the process of learning OAR (Organs at Risk) contouring using 3D Slicer.<br>
My present work is purely for training and research purposes (non-clinical), and in the future, I plan to develop an outsourcing support service for OAR contouring using 3D Slicer.<br>
I would be very grateful for your technical guidance on the following points:<br>
Recommended modules or extensions for automatic or semi-automatic OAR segmentation (e.g., Lung, Heart, Liver, Spinal Cord, etc.).<br>
Correct workflow for RTSTRUCT DICOM export — especially for ensuring geometry matches, metadata fields, and compatibility with TPS (like Monaco or RayStation).<br>
Any best practices for structure naming, DICOM metadata, or data integrity when exporting for radiotherapy planning.<br>
If there are any tutorials, example cases, or workflow videos you could recommend, that would be very helpful.<br>
Thank you for developing and maintaining such a powerful platform for medical image processing!<br>
With regards,<br>
Dr. [RUPEN RAJVIR]<br>
BHMS<br>
