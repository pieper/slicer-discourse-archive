<p><strong>As a beginner in SlicerAutoscoperM, I am currently focused on knee joint research. After successfully registering biplane data, I obtained a 4x4 homogeneous matrix. How can I derive the flexion angle, internal-external rotation angle, and abduction-adduction angle of the femur relative to the tibia (i.e., the three planar angles resulting from the registration)? Additionally, I would like to know how to adjust the position and orientation of my local coordinate system to align it with the world coordinate system. Furthermore, when bone motion exceeds the biplane imaging range, should I manually predict the movement by examining 3D images, or are there better methods available? Finally, could you provide a link to video tutorials for SlicerAutoscoperM, as I have not found detailed step-by-step instructions in the text documentation.</strong></p>

<p>Hi Gao,</p>
<p>Thank you for your interest in SlicerAutoscoperM! We have an extensive documentation section here <a href="https://autoscoperm.slicer.org/documentation/" class="inline-onebox">Documentation | SlicerAutoscoperM</a> that explain many of the questions that you have asked about (i.e. <a href="https://autoscoper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/transforms.html#transforms-in-slicerautoscoperm">world coordinate system registration</a>).</p>
<p>Some of our tutorial workshops include video explanations of the workflow (<a href="https://autoscoperm.slicer.org/events/2023/08/09/asb-2023-symposium.html">[1]</a> <a href="https://autoscoperm.slicer.org/events/2025/08/13/asb-2025-workshop.html">[2]</a>), some of these videos are not capturing the entire SAM functionality, but they are good guidelines to get started.</p>
<p>Additionally, you can reach out to our team! (contact information in our website). We, by demand, sometimes hold office hours.</p>
<p>HTH</p>
<p>Bea</p>
