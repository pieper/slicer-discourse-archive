<p>Dear Sir or Madam,</p>
<p>Do you mind me asking whether 3 D slicer can reconstruct CT/CBCT?</p>
<p>Yours sincerely</p>

<p>If you want to do 3D reconstruction from a series of 2D projections, you should take a look at <a href="https://www.openrtk.org/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">RTK</a> (Reconstruction Toolkit).</p>
