<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am currently using `slicer.app.slicerUserSettingsFilePath()` function to get the .ini file path when slicer is running and setting some entries. For example I set NumberOfFilesToKeep entry in the logging section. My question is how can I make slicer set the default default settings entries when I build it? Do I need to edit the cmake files?</p>
<p>Any help will be appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>
