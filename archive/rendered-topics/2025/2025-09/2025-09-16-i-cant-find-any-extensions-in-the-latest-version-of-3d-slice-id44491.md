<p>Today, I’ve downloaded the latest version of 3D Slicer (5.9.0-2025-09-14). When I installed it, I couldn’t find any extensions in the “Extension Manager”. How can I solve this issue? Thanks a lot.</p>

<p>There was an issue with the building of extensions for the 5.9.0-2025-09-14 version that has been resolved. Extensions have been built for today’s 5.9.0-2025-09-15 version.</p>

<p>There’s still something going on though, maybe it just needs time to catch up but if you click on the “<a href="https://extensions.slicer.org/catalog/All/33944/linux">browse extensions</a>” below the linux preview on <a href="http://download.slicer.org">download.slicer.org</a> it comes up empty (in fact, so do windows and mac).  But <a href="https://slicer.cdash.org/index.php?project=SlicerPreview">the dashboard</a> shows lots of extensions.</p>

<p>Yes as of right now <a href="http://download.slicer.org" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">download.slicer.org</a> is still showing 5.9.0-2025-09-14 (built 2025-09-15) and the browse extensions for that version. The page hasn’t yet updated to reflect the 5.9.0-2025-09-15 version (built 2025-09-16).</p>
<p>This is likely because it is still actively building the nightly extensions for the Slicer stable.</p>

<p>Things have caught up now and today’s extensions are looking good for all platforms.</p>
