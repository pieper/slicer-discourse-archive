<p>Hello all,</p>
<p>I am trying to segment and calculate tumor volume for spine neurofibromas in mice models. I acquired T2 TurboRARE images for axial, coronal and sagittal orientations separately. I am seeing tumors in few slices only in each orientation. Currently I am just using the draw option from segment editor to draw tumors in slices and then open the quantification to create a table that gives the tumor volume.</p>
<p>So, my question is should should i calculate tumor volume in each orientation separately or combine them all? If so, how? Also, if i want a 3D view of my images with tumors how can i do that? I am actually new to this, so any detailed suggestions would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
