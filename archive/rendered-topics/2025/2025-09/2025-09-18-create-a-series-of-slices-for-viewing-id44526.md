<p>Hello! Sorry if this has been asked before, but I really don’t seem to be able to find how to extract a series of slices from a selected ROI for viewing purposes. For example, I want to have 1mm step 0,5mm thickness slices of a selected area exported as a series of images in a format like PDF.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Sophia</p>

<p>You can use the <a href="https://discourse.slicer.org/t/new-lightbox-contact-image-mode-in-screen-capture-module/10840">Screen Capture module’s lightbox mode</a>.</p>
