<p>Hi all<br>
I already have a myocardium segmentation (label map) from short-axis cardiac MRI.<br>
What I need on one chosen slice, place a center point and draw radial wedge lines at fixed angles (basal/mid: 6×60°, apical: 4×90°). These lines should only appear on that slice , and I should be able to rotate the wedge easily (e.g., to align with RV insertion).<br>
Is there any built-in way or existing module that can create such per-slice wedge overlays?<br>
If not, is there a manual tool/workflow I can use slice-by-slice (e.g., with Markups) to achieve the same result?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
