<p>Hello!</p>
<p>I have two problems with the “bone texture” extension:</p>
<p>1.) BM features result can’t be exported into a table (error: Please specify an output csv file) and BM feature maps can’t be exported as dwi files (exports only in .nrrd)</p>
<p>2.) In which units are the BM features measured? The numbers I get from a microCT scan of a mouse femur seem strange, especially for TbN, TbTh, and TbSp, but without units I can’t compare them to the literature</p>
<p>Thank you so much for help.</p>
