<p>I got myself in trouble with opening the application on Windows 11 v24H2.</p>
<p>Context: Our lab was moving so I had to unplug my desktop for a month. Couple of days before when I clicked on the 3D Slicer icon, I saw the app in blank white. I have tried uninstall, re-install, install multiple versions, but nothing worked. I have also updated the Windows but no difference. Before moving the lab, I worked on the app perfectly.</p>
<p>Current status: When I move the cursor to the menu bar, it can show the options but nothing more.</p>
<p>Question: What would be the cause and how to solve it? I really appreciate any help.</p>

<p>Application is launching but GUI is not visible. This is often due to graphics driver issues. Windows often updates quite a bit of things after the computer has been offline a while.</p>
<p>Perhaps reinstalling the graphics driver on your system and then see if it works.</p>
<p>Also do you have more than one GPU in your system (eg., an integrated one and a discrete one).</p>
