<p>I’ve created a comprehensive video tutorial that walks through my full workflow for performing virtual surgical planning (VSP) for orthognathic surgery.</p>
<p>The video covers everything from aligning CT scans and intra-oral scan data to performing virtual osteotomies and designing the final surgical splint. I’ve focused on using only 3D Slicer.</p>
<p>You can watch the full tutorial here: <a href="https://youtu.be/4I-9qnmvCLY?si=lsGTCZCSqWOpJai_" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://youtu.be/4I-9qnmvCLY?si=lsGTCZCSqWOpJai_</a></p>
<p>I hope this resource is helpful for other surgeons, residents, and anyone interested in advancing their digital planning skills. Feedback and discussion are welcome!</p>
<p>Thank You</p>
