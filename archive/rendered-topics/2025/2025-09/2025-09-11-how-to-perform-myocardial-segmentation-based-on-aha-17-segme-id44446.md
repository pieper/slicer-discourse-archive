<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>I’m trying to calculate cardiac ADC values using 3D Slicer (v5.8.1), both globally and based on the AHA 17-segment model. However, I’m unsure how to perform myocardial segmentation. I’ve installed the SlicerHeart extension, but haven’t been able to locate tools specifically for myocardial segmentation.</p>
<p>Would anyone be able to point me in the right direction? Any guidance would be greatly appreciated!</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>
