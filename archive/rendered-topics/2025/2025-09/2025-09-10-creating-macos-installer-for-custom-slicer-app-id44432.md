<p>I have built and packaged my custom Slicer application on a Windows machine using Visual Studio.</p>
<p>Now I want to create a macOS installer for the same custom application. Is it possible to generate a macOS package directly from Windows, or do I need to build and package the application on a macOS machine?</p>
<p>Any guidance would be appreciated!</p>
