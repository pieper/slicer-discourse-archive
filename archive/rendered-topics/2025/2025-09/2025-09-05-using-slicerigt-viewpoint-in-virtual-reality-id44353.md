<p>Hello, I have been experimenting with an IGT setup in Slicer which I want to visualize with a virtual reality headset. Now I am trying to match the VR view to the actual perspective on the phantom and tool by also tracking the headset. I managed to show the desired perspective in the 3D-view window using the Viewpoint module of SlicerIGT, but I couldn’t find a way to get that same perspective in VR.</p>
<p>I am quite new to this and would appreciate some feedback on wether this is even possible (ideally without writing my own code) or if I should provide more details.<br>
Thanks.</p>
