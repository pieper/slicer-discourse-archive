<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have 2 models on the scene, one is near and one is far from the camera, the <code>nearModel</code> is occluding part of the <code>farModel</code>. I also have a <code>markupsPointList</code>. I want my markup points to <em>“not see”</em> the <code>nearModel</code> while I move a point over the <code>nearModel</code> (and the <code>farModel</code>) so the point ends up exactly over the <code>farModel</code>, is there a way to achieve that? Another solution, although less preferable, would be if I could make my markup points always snap to the <code>farModel</code>, would that be possible?</p>
<p>Thank you</p>
