<p>been working on creating a personalized web app these days . personally i have zero coding skill or desire to learn coding . what i did is open Visual studio code . it has integrated chat GPT codex module . which can intrpret and modify codes based on prompt .</p>
<p>is it possible to do a workflow for slicer ? bear in mind i have no idea how do or what it takes . all i know is that i want to be able to open a prompt dialogue and tell Ai to change this or add that and it reads and changes the codes similato whay im doing right now .</p>
<p>i have finished like 50 percent of an app idea in less than a day and on going . very promisgin potential i wish i cant experiment in 3d slicer</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/lassoan">@lassoan</a> what do you think ?</p>
