<p>I am new to 3D slicer app, but I am looking for someone to write a simple script that can automate the calculation of Volume and Surface area of a 3D Mesh, without deploying the entire 3D Slicer application.</p>

<p>Hi Anthony,</p>
<p>I would be happy to work on this 3D Slicer script for you.</p>
<p>I am well versed with 3D Slicer and can create something to calculate mesh metrics independently.</p>
<p>The volume and surface area calculations should be straightforward to implement without needing the full application.</p>
<p>Let me know what mesh formats you typically work with so I can tailor the solution accordingly.</p>
<p>You can reach out to me on my <a href="mailto:colinwilliams8254@gmail.com">email here</a></p>
<p>Colin</p>
