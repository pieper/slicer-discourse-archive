<p>SlicerAstro currently has no active funding, and I maintain it in my free time. Unfortunately, it’s not compatible with the latest Slicer Stable and Preview versions. I plan to update SlicerAstro extension (probably around the end of the year), but for the moment, you can try using the binaries of the custom SlicerAstroApp (with an older version of Slicer) available at the following link: <a href="https://github.com/Punzo/SlicerAstroApp/releases" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Releases · Punzo/SlicerAstroApp · GitHub</a> . Full wiki is at <a href="https://github.com/Punzo/SlicerAstro/wiki" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Home · Punzo/SlicerAstro Wiki · GitHub</a></p>
<p>Please let me know if they work for you.</p>
<p>Davide.</p>
