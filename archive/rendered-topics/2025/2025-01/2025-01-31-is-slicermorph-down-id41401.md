<p>Hi, I’m new to Slicer3D and would like to use SlicerMorph but the webpages don’t work and the extension won’t work - is it no longer available?</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Github locked the slicermorph account for erroneously detected “suspicious” activity yesterday. The account and repositories should be back online, but I think it missed the build time cut off.  Try tomorrow.</p>
