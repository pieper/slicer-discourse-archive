<p>Hi all,<br>
I will be purchasing a new laptop computer for using in a research project related to Ultrasound Transducers and Other cameras connected with Optical trackers and SlicerIGT. I have only a pretty basic knowledge of computer programs or hardware. Are there any specific recommendations of what I should be looking for to store and compile a large dataset?</p>
<p>Thank you in advance</p>
