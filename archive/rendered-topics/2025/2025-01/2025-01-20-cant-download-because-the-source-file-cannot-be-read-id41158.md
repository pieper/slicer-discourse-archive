<p>I’m working on Windows 11, can’t download 5.6.2. It gets to about 15% and then stops. I get a message saying ‘can’t download because the source file cannot be read’. I have not used 3D slicer for a while, but the 4.10.2 version I used to use is crashing so I thought time to get the latest version. No luck. Currently can’t use at all.</p>

<p>Please try again. Maybe on a different computer or a more reliable network. About 1000 people download 3D Slicer every day and they don’t report any problems.</p>

<p>They all download fine without any problem on my connections.</p>
<p>This tells me something is stopping your download (particularly if it is consistently at the same time). make sure you are NOT behind a corporate firewall that may block downloads.</p>

<p>Thanks for replies. I have tried on a different computer, but similar response. Not corporate environment so that’s not the reason. No problem downloading anything else. I shall keep working on it. Thanks again.</p>

<p>Weird. That still looks like a unique network issue to me. No one else seems to report a download problem.</p>
<p>See if you can get a public wifi somewhere else and try to download from there.</p>

<p>In case you’re still struggling, here’s a download link from my personal drive <a href="https://1drv.ms/u/s!Ao_a-dPPX98ZiJBb2yTZRnE49mvmUg?e=p4MThR">Slicer-5.6.2-win-amd64.exe</a></p>

<p>I am getting the same error. I am trying to download Slicer since yesterday in the Linux version, but I am not able to complete the download. I have tried downloading it on different computers and in the server but it keeps failing on all of them. However I have no problem downloading anything else.</p>

<p>Clearly there is something blocking the specific application on your end. Maybe you have an antivirus software? If so, temporarily turn it off and then try again.</p>

<p>Thank you all for your replies and suggestions. I am unable to move my set up to a different internet location, but I did try on a lap top. The same problem happened. I tried different browsers and the same problem. However, I hot spotted my computer to my phone last night and it worked, so it would seem that it is a problem with my internet connection. It did crash once, but second attempt it downloaded completely. Interestingly, I downloaded other software yesterday using the original internet connection and had no problems, so there must be something specific to 3D slicer that my connection doesn’t like.<br>
Finally I can get back to using 3D Slicer. BTW, I use the software to make artwork. It’s fascinating. Thanks again for your suggestions.</p>

<p>Glad to hear it worked.  Share some of your images if you can, we’d love to see.</p>

<p>Agreed - those are great!</p>

<p>Thanks. I mainly work photographically, but the cross over into 3D and CT scanning has been amazing…and challenging.</p>

<p>Just FYI, deleting the mirror link I created. Agreed, if you cannot download from OneDrive, it’s not a server problem, it’s something related to your provider or the local network.</p>

<p>Very nice renderings. You may find some recently added features very useful for tour work.</p>
<p>Colorized Volume Rendering module in Sandbox extension can color a volume by a segmentation. You can use it to paint into a volume and display the result in 3D.</p>
<p>You can use Lights module in Sandbox extension to enable ambient shadows. It can make the rendering look much more realistic.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <a class="mention" href="/u/lucasgandel">@LucasGandel</a> I’ve experimented with your code a bit and I think that IntensityScale property is not used optimally. If we use scaling &lt; 1 values then the shadows are just become too weak - almost no shadowing occurs. However, using scaling &gt; 1 values seem useful, as they can increase darkening. But we would not want to darken values that are below the VolumeOpacityThreshold, because that would just make the entire image dark. To solve this, I would propose to scale around the VolumeOpacityThresh…
