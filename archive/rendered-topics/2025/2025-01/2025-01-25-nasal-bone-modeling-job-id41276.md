<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am searching for an experienced professional to show how a crooked nasal bone forces cartilidge and the top of the septum to not only be crooked but to hit the lateral walls of the nose. I am trying to replicate both articles below. Thank you!</p>
<p>I have both a 64 slice CT that shows crooked nasal bones and a Nasal MRI that needs to be used to build the septum and lateral cartilidges of the nose.</p>

<p>I really want to show how the cooked nasal bone causes the septum and cartilidge hitting the wrong parts of my nose causing me pain!</p>
<p>Thanks so much!</p>
<p>Can you please provide your email and I can send you the dicom files for both the CT and MRI</p>
