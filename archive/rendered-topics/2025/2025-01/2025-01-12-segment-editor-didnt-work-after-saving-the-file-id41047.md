<p>Hello!<br>
I work with Slicer 5.6.2 , win10.<br>
Hello, I am using Slicer 5.6.2 on Windows 10.</p>
<p>My issue is as follows: After saving the file, the Segment Editor is no longer working. I saved my progress as a .mrb file during the work, but after that, the content I was working on in the Segment Editor is no longer rendered in 3D, and I can’t use the paint tool either. The Volume Rendering works fine, but why is the Segment Editor not functioning?</p>

<p>with the log file, or the mrb file, we cannot point out the issue. If you can share your MRB, we can take a look at the issue.</p>

<p>You need to make it publicly available. I can’t download it.</p>

<p>Oh… I’m really sorry that I miss controlling the transparency of the segmentation.</p>
<p>I controlled the transparency, and solved the problem.</p>
<p>Thank you for your interest.!</p>
