<p>Hi,<br>
I produce 3D reconstructions using version 5.6.2 of 3D Slicer. Could this cause opening or reading errors if the reconstruction is opened with version 5.8.0 ?Thanks in advance !</p>

<p>As long as you have a mrml or mrb file that reconstitutes your scene correctly in 5.6.2, it should work fine with 5.8.0</p>

<p>Thank you for your answer, I am working with nrrd files.<br>
My fear is that display and volumes of structures obtained with 5.6.2 is not the same when opening with 5.8.0, is that possible ?</p>

<p>There should be no difference, but if you see any let us know.</p>
