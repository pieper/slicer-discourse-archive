<p>Hi, Everyone!<br>
Recently, I have acquired 2D cine MRI data. For the sagittal and short-axis planes, the cine series contains 20 frames per plane. I have already created the LV model at the ED phase.<br>
I would like to reconstruct the beating model based on the above data, but I am unsure if this approach is feasible.<br>
Therefore, I would like to ask for your suggestions and any related experiences.</p>
