<p>Hello everyone!</p>

I looked everywhere for instructions which all brinigng up Tool Options → Mode but i cannot fine the Tool Options. I even search in Settings and there is no User settings there. Anyone please who can help how, where can I activate the fill in mode or any other simple way to get a closed loop filled in on the Segmentation Editor?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for the help.</p>

<p>This feature is provided by the <code>Draw</code> effect (works only on a single slice in 2D, allows freehand and polygon drawing) and <code>Scissors</code> effect (works in 2D - single or multiple slices - and also in 3D).</p>
