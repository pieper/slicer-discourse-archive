<p>The <a href="https://ciroraggio.github.io/SlicerImageAugmenter/tutorial" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">ImageAugmenter</a> extension can be helpful. It’s available in the Preview Release of 3D Slicer (currently v5.7.0).</p>

<p>It can be used with any kind of volume, not just CTs. In this case, I don’t know if it can be the best option, but you can try it.</p>
