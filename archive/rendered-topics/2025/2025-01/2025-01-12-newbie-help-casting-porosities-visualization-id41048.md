<p>Hello everyone.<br>
I found out this site and have a few questions. I was sent an MRB file (ct scan of a casting). I downloaded the slicer program, and I was able to open it. The main thing that I am interested in is the internal casting porosities. Is there a way to visualize the porosities in 3D ? like different color for the porosities where I can view them easily (rotate the casting, zoom in/out on the porosities, etc). If so, if you don’t mind helping me out by giving me steps to do so ? Thank you so very much !</p>
