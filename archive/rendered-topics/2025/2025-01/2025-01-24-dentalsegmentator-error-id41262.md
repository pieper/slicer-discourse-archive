<p>Hello<br>
I downloaded preview version 5.7 and I could not use the dental segmentator, this error appears in the console:<br>
[Qt] void __cdecl qMRMLSegmentEditorWidget::setSourceVolumeNode(class vtkMRMLNode *)  failed: need to set segment editor and segmentation nodes first<br>
How can I fix it?<br>
Also, is dental segmentator only used with NVIDIA driver?</p>
