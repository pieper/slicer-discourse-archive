<p>I need help with the AREG module. I have footage before and after treatment. I created the DentalSegmenetator module, saving the files as NIFITI. Then, in the AREG module, before adding T1 and T2, the message “does not have T1 and T2 scans” appears.<br>
I recorded a video of myself performing these actions - here’s the <a href="https://youtu.be/625xyp53nSc" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">LINK</a>. Can anyone help?.</p>
