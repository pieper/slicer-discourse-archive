<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I remember that the previous version of Total Segmentator had an option to segment liver vessels and tumors. This option is not available anymore in v2. Could I somehow downgrade to v1 in the extension to use this feature? Or do you have any other tip how could I automatically segment it?</p>
<p>Thanks a lot!</p>
