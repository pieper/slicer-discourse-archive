<p>Is it possible to take a segmentation and c/p it? I segmented 5 pieces of anatomy; however, I needed them aligned to my CT not the MR. Trying to save time from re-segmenting all of them.</p>

<p>Can you define c/p?</p>
<p>Regarding aligning MR and CT, see the Registration tutorials and documentation.</p>
