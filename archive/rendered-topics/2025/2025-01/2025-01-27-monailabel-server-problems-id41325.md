<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am facing a problem with the server connection.</p>
<p>. Running on my own pc (Windows 11)<br>
. 3D Slicer installed with MonaiLabel plug-in working<br>
. Tryed Anaconda, Python 3.11 and Visual Studio Code as an interface<br>
. Followed precisely all tutorials from Andres Pinto and the server remains not working<br>
. Tried to mix my personal IP with the Port :8000 and the error remains</p>
<p>Could you please help me?</p>
<p>KR,<br>
