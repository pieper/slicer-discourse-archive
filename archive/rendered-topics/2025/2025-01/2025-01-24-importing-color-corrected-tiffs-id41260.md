<p>Hello! Hope you’re all having a lovely January so far.</p>
<p>I recently received a scan that I needed to do some color correcting to, in order to increase contrast. I have done so in Lightroom since that is the program that is most familiar to me. I exported them from Lightroom as TIFFs. However, when I go to import them using ImageStacks in Slicer, I get this error message: “Loading failed: ‘NoneType’ object has no attribute ‘shape’”</p>
<p>Does anyone know what this means or how I can fix it? Do I need to edit the TIFF files in a different software? If so, what do you recommend?</p>
<p>Thanks for your help!</p>
