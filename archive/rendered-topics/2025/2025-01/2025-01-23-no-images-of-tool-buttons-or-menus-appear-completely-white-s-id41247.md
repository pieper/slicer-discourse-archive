<p>It looks like your computer or graphics driver is <a href="https://slicer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/getting_started.html#system-requirements">too old</a>. What CPU and GPU model does your computer have?</p>

<p>Unfortunately that is a very old CPU, from a decade ago. You will need a newer cpu than that.</p>
