<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>As far as I can see, development moved from the <code>master</code> branch to a <code>main</code> branch about 2.5 years ago. I’m not sure when the generation of apidocs was changed to fit this.</p>
<p>Today, I was looking for docs on <code>AddArchetypeScalarVolume</code> and on <code>vtkSlicerVolumesLogic</code>, and in both cases, both Bing and DuckDuckGo return results pointing to “master” (e.g. <a href="https://apidocs.slicer.org/master/classvtkSlicerVolumesLogic.html" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://apidocs.slicer.org/master/classvtkSlicerVolumesLogic.html</a>) which are no longer existing pages (I checked Google for comparison, and it returns results from older branches, like <code>v5.2</code>).</p>
<p>Is it possible to arrange for a redirect from <code>master</code> to <code>main</code> in the apidocs?</p>
