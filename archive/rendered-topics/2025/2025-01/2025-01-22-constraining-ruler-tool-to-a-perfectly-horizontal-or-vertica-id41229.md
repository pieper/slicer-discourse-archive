<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have a question regarding the ruler tool and creating a measurement line. Is there a way to ‘snap’ the line to a perfectly horizontal or vertical line? For example, in other applications I can hold down the “shift” key and this constrains the line I’m drawing to a horizontal (0 degree) line.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
