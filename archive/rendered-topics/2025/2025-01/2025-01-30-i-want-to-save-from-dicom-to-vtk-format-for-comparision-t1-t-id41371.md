<p>Hello</p>
<p>I’m a newbie user of 3d-slicer.</p>
<p>I want to save a face image from a dicom file to a vtk file.</p>
<p>I’m reaching out to you because I’ve been searching on my own and can’t seem to find the answer.</p>
<p>I want to use the shape-population viewer for before and after treatment comparisons, and it seems that this module only supports VTK files.</p>
<p>After loading the DICOM file into 3D-Slicer, I can’t seem to separate it like this in the segment editor and save it as a VTK, so I was wondering if you know how to do it.</p>
<p>PLEASE, HELP Me</p>
