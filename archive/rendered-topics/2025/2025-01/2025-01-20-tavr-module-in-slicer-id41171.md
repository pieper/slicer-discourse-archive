<p>Hi all,<br>
I saw <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6q8-pK42zyg&amp;ab_channel=CRISPConference" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">this video</a> and I was wondering which extension/module is that (and how to get it).</p>
<p>Any idea?</p>
<p>Thanks a lot.<br>
Paolo</p>

<p>He showed the category of the SlicerHeart extension, but the “TAVR” module he principally showed is not in said extension, so possibly something custom made.</p>
