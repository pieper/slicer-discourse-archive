<p>“Hello, I am working on CT reconstructions, I do the segmentation with Total Segmentation, then I export it as an OBJ file. I have been able to open the project with Blender or MeshLab, but what I need is to be able to open it with PowerPoint or another similar Office program that allows me to work with the segments and show/hide them individually. When I open it in PowerPoint, it opens as a single model.”<br>
I would be very grateful if someone could help me.</p>
