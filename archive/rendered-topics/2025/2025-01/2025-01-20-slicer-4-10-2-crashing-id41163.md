<p>Operating system: Windows<br>
Slicer version: 4.10.2<br>
Expected behavior: To be able to use the software<br>
Actual behavior:<br>
Slicer keeps crashing when using. I haven’t used this software for quite some time, so thought I would upgrade to latest version. Unfortunately I can’t download it. It gets to about 15% of download and then goes back to the start.<br>
I have returned to previous version but still keeps crashing.</p>

<p>Please use the latest Slicer release. We cannot offer support for troubleshooting old Slicer versions, because it would take time away from fixing/improving the current version.</p>
<p>We can discuss your difficulties in downloading Slicer in the <a href="https://discourse.slicer.org/t/cant-download-because-the-source-file-cannot-be-read/41158/1">topic that you already opened</a>.</p>
