<p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>I’m working on a project involving head CT imaging and need to identify and correct artifacts that may interfere with analysis. I’m particularly interested in open-source models or algorithms that can be used within <strong>3D Slicer</strong> or integrated into a similar pipeline without licensing costs.</p>
<p>Specifically, I’m looking for:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Artifact detection</strong> (e.g., motion, beam hardening, metal artifacts).</li>
<li><strong>Correction methods</strong> that do not require extensive retraining.</li>
<li><strong>Plugins or extensions</strong> within Slicer that might be useful.</li>
</ul>
<p>If anyone has experience with existing models, filters, or workflows that could help with this, I’d appreciate any recommendations!</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!<br>
JO</p>
