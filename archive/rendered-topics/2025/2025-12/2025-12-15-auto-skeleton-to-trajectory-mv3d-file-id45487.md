<p>Hello, I am thinking that a commercial software called Avizo could do auto skeleton and output the trajectory as mv3d (MicroVisu3D) file</p>
<p>mv3d header looks like this</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"># MicroVisu3D file
# Number of lines   1
# Number of points  xxx
# Number of inter.  0
#
# No		x		y		z		d
#
</code></pre>
<p>Could I know if there is any similar function in 3D slicer?</p>
<p>Best regards</p>
