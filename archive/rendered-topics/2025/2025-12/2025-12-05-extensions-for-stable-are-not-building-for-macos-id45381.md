<p>No Mac extensions. Windows and Linux seems fine:</p>

<p>I see mac extension builds showing up now, maybe it was just delayed? (I don’t have access to computron atm.) There are a lot of stragglers showing up on Dec 6, and still rolling in as I write this</p>

<p>OK, looks like MacOS builds didn’t even start until couple hours ago. At this point I am not sure if this is soon to be yesterday’s build, or actually the build for tomorrow (Saturday). Looks like similar issue to this: <a href="https://discourse.slicer.org/t/slicer-build-factory-speed/45358" class="inline-onebox">Slicer build factory speed</a></p>
