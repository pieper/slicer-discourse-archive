<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I study imprints in ceramics and I want to reproduce a tool by averaging different meshes of the imprint. I used the average mesh module, selected my different meshes as inputs, creating a new model as output, but i get an error saying “failed to compute output model: operands could not be broadcast together with shapes (two random numbers)”.</p>
<p>Does anybody knows how to solve this problem ?</p>
