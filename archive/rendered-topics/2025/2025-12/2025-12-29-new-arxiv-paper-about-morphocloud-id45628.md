<p>Hi <a class="mention" href="/u/muratmaga">@muratmaga</a>, does MorphoCloud support commercial systems too?</p>

<p><a class="mention" href="/u/amyers">@amyers</a> what do you mean by commercial systems? As per our host’s (JetStream2) acceptable use policy, we cannot allow commercial usage of the platform since it is meant to support research and teaching activities. But if you mean if you can install commercial software on it, as long as you have the license for it and your license allows you to install on virtual cloud computers, you can. However, if that’s the case it might be more meaningful to obtain your own allocation that will give you more freedom on what you can do on the platform.</p>

<p>I interpreted the question as “Does MorphoCloud support commercial cloud providers (Amazon/Google/Microsoft)?”.</p>

<p>If they are supporting openstack based provisioning, I think it could work. But I believe most have their own orchestation API, which would require customization of the current code.</p>

<p>I was referring to a commercial system that uses 3D Slicer for processing. There’s a commercial system that uses 3D Slicer with some scripts for automation. I could put these scripts within the PerkLab repository along with any MorphoCloud changes. Then any external commercial application can leverage this functionality. The resulting output, such as segmentations, could be transferred to the client host commercial system.</p>

<p>The paper for MorphoCloud is now available as</p>
<p>Maga AM, Fillion-Robin J-C (2026) MorphoCloud: Democratizing Access to High-Performance Computing for Morphological Data Analysis. <a href="https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.176328.1" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.176328.1</a></p>
<p>F1000Research does open peer-reviews (still pending) and it also provides a commentary/discussion for the paper from the community. Feel free to add your thoughts (that’s one reason I chose them).</p>
