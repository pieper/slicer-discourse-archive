<p>Hi! I’m kinda new to radiomics and don’t know much about image normalization. I want to extract radiomic features from MRI glioblastoma images. I’ve managed to apply an N4ITK bias filter and a z-score normalization, but I’m not quite sure about the values of the features extracted (they don’t seem related to the features whatsoever and differ a lot from the ones obtained without normalisation).I’m working with 2D images and masks.</p>
<p>I was wondering if there’s a pipeline anywhere that works?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
