<p><strong>Hello. I am Giorgio, a biomedical engineering student in Verona, and I am working with 3D Slicer for an internship.</strong></p>
<p><strong>My task is to create a custom Slicer application. I am trying to integrate the Segment Editor window into my interface, but I am running into issues. The custom application crashes whenever I try to use the Paint, Erase, or Smoothing buttons.</strong></p>
<p><strong>How can I fix this problem?</strong></p>
