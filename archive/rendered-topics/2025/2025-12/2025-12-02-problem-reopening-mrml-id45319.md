<p>Slicer Version: 5.8.1</p>
<p>Macbook Pro with 356 GB available</p>
<p>Hello! I am very new to 3DSlicer and forums as a whole. I was hoping for some help as I have run into an issue with reuploading my segmented CT scan. I made sure to save it as I was segmenting, and when saving for the first time, I made a new folder embedded inside the same folder as the CT images, as I have read that it is essential that the Slicer and image files are in the same place. Unfortunately, the system crashed on me (I am realizing that my computer perhaps does not have the capacity to run the program) and so I had to force quit the program and restart my laptop. I was able to get back in to the program, however, it is not letting me reupload my scan. I plan on moving everything to an external hard drive and locating a desktop that can run the program near me, hopefully at my local university and continuing my project there… but the problem still stands that I have no idea how to reopen the files.</p>
<p>Thank you so much to whichever kind soul decides to help me!</p>

<p>Some more details would help us help you.  Slicer crashing should not have corrupted the most recently saved data, unless perhaps it crashed during saving.  Slicer can save a scene as a single file (.mrb extension) or as individual files with a single scene file to organize them (.mrml) extension.  Which way were you saving as you went along?</p>

<p>Hi!</p>
<p>If you are using .mrb extension to save your project, you can simply drag and drop the .mrb file into a new 3dSlicer scene.</p>
