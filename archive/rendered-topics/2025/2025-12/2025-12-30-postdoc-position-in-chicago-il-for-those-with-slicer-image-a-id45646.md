<p>Perform  segmentation of craniofacial skeletal structures and upper airway anatomy from CT and CBCT data using 3D Slicer</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Develop, validate, and refine <strong>craniofacial and orthognathic landmarking protocols</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Conduct 3D morphometric, volumetric, and airway analyses pre- and post-surgery</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Standardize and document reproducible image analysis pipelines</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Collaborate closely with surgeon-scientists and clinical researchers, as well as biomedical engineering collaborators</p>
