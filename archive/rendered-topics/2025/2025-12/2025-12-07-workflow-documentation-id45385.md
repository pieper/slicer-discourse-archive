<p>Hellow everyone,</p>
<p>I want to know if there is any option to have a file\note with all the actions that I do while I’m trying to segment an image.</p>
<p>For example, if I first did median filter and then threshold…</p>
<p>so, I can export the file with the actions that I applied written in the file.</p>

<p>You can search for or create a new folder within a computer-related directory to keep track of your work.</p>
