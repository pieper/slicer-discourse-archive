<p>I am working on a research project focused on environmental radioprotection. The goal is to develop voxelized phantoms of terrestrial species to study the radiological effects of pollutants. I have a CT-scan series of a frog and I need an expert to perform the precise segmentation of its internal organs.</p>
<p>I am looking for someone proficient in 3D Slicer to handle the manual or semi-automatic segmentation of various organs from the CT DICOM files.</p>
<p>Once the segmentation is complete, I will use these 3D models to calculate internal dosimetric functions for radioactive waste studies. This task is essential to replace primitive geometric shapes with realistic anatomical models.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

<p>If you have good-quality image then you can segment each organ by one (or maybe a few) clicks using <a href="https://github.com/coendevente/SlicerNNInteractive">NNInteractive extension</a>.</p>

<p>I agree with Andras, nnInteractive should be good for this.  I have tried it with a salamander microCT scan with good results.</p>

<p>Iamradiology technologist with strong experience in CT and MRI image analysis and precise segmentation using 3D Slicer.</p>
<p>I have hands-on experience in organ segmentation, anatomical labeling, and 3D modeling for both CT and MRI datasets, including research-oriented projects.</p>
<p>My background allows me to ensure voxel-accurate segmentations suitable for radiological, dosimetric, and AI-related studies.</p>
<p>I would be glad to review a sample dataset and discuss project details.</p>

<p>Hello <a class="mention" href="/u/eslamzaied222">@eslamzaied222</a>,</p>
<p>Thank you for your message and for sharing your experience — it sounds very relevant to what I’m working on.</p>
<p>I would like to contact you to discuss this further, but I don’t seem to have the option to send a private message here. If you’re open to it, could you please share an email address or another way to get in touch so we can talk in more detail?</p>
<p>Thank you, and I look forward to hearing from you.</p>

<p>We encourage discussion on the forum, so that others can learn from your experience as well. If it is your data that you don’t want to make publically visible, then I suggest finding openly accessible data of the same kind using which you can continue discussing the method.</p>

<p>Thank you for the advice! I’m definitely interested in getting more details on this approach. I’ll look for some openly accessible data that mirrors my situation, and as soon as I figure out the best way to move forward, I’ll share the results here so the community can learn from the experience too.</p>
