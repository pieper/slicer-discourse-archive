<p>Hello! I am looking to hire someone for a tutorial for my research project.</p>
<p>My project only has 3D models in STL format (no DICOM), and I need to crop certain aspects and measure the volume of of my region of interest.</p>
<p>Please contact me at: <a href="mailto:julietran1998@gmail.com">julietran1998@gmail.com</a></p>
<p>Thank you!</p>
<p>Julie</p>
