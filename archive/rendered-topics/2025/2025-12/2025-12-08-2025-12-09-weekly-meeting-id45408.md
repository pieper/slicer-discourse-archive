<p>Notes from the meeting</p>
<h2><a name="p-130536-qt6-support-1" class="anchor" href="#p-130536-qt6-support-1" aria-label="Heading link"></a>Qt6 support</h2>
<p>Andras and James have worked the last batch of Qt6 support commits in this morning, <a href="https://github.com/Slicer/Slicer/pull/8893">PR#8893</a>. We’ll encourage people to play with that for a couple of weeks, and then once the first wave of issues is handled we’ll turn it on for the nightly releases.</p>
<p>Sam will be working on getting Qt6 sorted out on the factory machines.</p>
<h2><a name="p-130536-telemetry-2" class="anchor" href="#p-130536-telemetry-2" aria-label="Heading link"></a>Telemetry</h2>
<ul>
<li>Bernie will have more time to work on this, so getting the server set up at Kitware can go forward. <a href="https://github.com/BerDom-Ing/" class="inline-onebox">BerDom-Ing (Bernardo Dominguez) · GitHub</a> <a href="https://github.com/Slicer/SlicerTelemetry" class="inline-onebox">GitHub - Slicer/SlicerTelemetry</a></li>
<li>Mauro has been testing with his extension and a temporary server</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="p-130536-support-for-reading-2d-transforms-3" class="anchor" href="#p-130536-support-for-reading-2d-transforms-3" aria-label="Heading link"></a>Support for reading 2D transforms</h2>
<p>Dženan’s work on supporting 2D transforms is ready for another review: <a href="https://github.com/Slicer/Slicer/pull/8842">PR#8842</a>.</p>
<p>(It applies to all transform types, not just linear.)</p>
<p>Comments: It may be easier to review if the transform precision stuff is moved into a separate pull request. Or perhaps squash those into a separate commit?</p>
<h2><a name="p-130536-dev-containers-4" class="anchor" href="#p-130536-dev-containers-4" aria-label="Heading link"></a>Dev containers</h2>
<p>There is a <a href="https://github.com/Slicer/Slicer/pull/8861">PR#8861</a> which is a WIP by Ruffin on adding dev containers to the repo. There is significant interest by developers in this kind of thing. The dev containers are development tool that can live in the repo itself – they are kind of off to the side in a <code>.devcontainer/</code> so there isn’t a reason not have them tracked in the repo.</p>
<p>There are already docker images for building Slicer, but Ruffin was not aware of them when initially putting this together. So he is now reworking the PR to start off of the Slicer docker image rather a base ubuntu  one. It will build on top of the Slicer docker image, but add more tooling for developers to create a convenient dev environment.</p>
