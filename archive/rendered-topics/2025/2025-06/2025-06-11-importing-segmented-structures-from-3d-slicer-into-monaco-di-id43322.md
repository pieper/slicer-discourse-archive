<p>Good afternoon!<br>
I’d like to inquire about how to import segmented structures from 3D Slicer into Monaco (in DICOM) and ensure they are displayed as contours (Structures). I am unsure whether Monaco supports working with segmentations created in third-party software.</p>
<p>Could you please provide guidance on this matter?</p>
<p>Thank you in advance!</p>

<p>You should be able to do this with SlicerRT (<a href="https://slicerrt.github.io/">https://slicerrt.github.io/</a>)</p>
