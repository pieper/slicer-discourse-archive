<p>Dear Project Week attendees,</p>
<p>We are looking forward to welcoming you in Montreal next Monday for the 43rd edition of the NA-MIC Project Week.</p>
<p>Doors will open at 8am on Monday and coffee will be served starting at 9am. We will begin official activities with project introductions at 10am. A detailed schedule is available on the <a href="https://projectweek.na-mic.org/PW43_2025_Montreal/#location">Project Week 43 webpage</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://projectweek.na-mic.org/PW43_2025_Montreal/#location">Project Week 43 webpage</a> also contains detailed instructions on how to get to the conference room. For those who attended Project Week in Montreal in 2023, the venue is the same so you should find your way easily.</p>
<p>If you have submitted a project proposal for this edition of Project Week, please make sure to fill out the details of your project before Monday and make sure to remove the “draft” tag on <a href="https://github.com/NA-MIC/ProjectWeek/issues">the Github issue associated with the project</a>. Doing so will ensure the project is properly listed on the Project Week 43 webpage, which will be used as the only visual support during project introductions on Monday.</p>
<p>Looking forward to seeing you all on Monday!</p>
<p>Best.</p>
<p>The Project Week organizing committee<br>
(Tina Kapur, Simon Drouin, Rafael Palomar, Sam Horvath)</p>
