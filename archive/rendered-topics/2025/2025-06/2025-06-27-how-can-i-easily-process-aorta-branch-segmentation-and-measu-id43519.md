<p>Hello everyone,<br>
I am a new user who just learned about slicer.<br>
I am having a hard time learning about each one, so I need help.<br>
In the abdominal CT(CE), the aorta and IVC are lightened both in the delayed phase, and what I want is to find the x, y, and z axes of the location where the aorta and its branches, Ceiliac trunk SMA renal artery IMA aortic bifurcation, iliac bifurcation femoral bifurcation, and the arterial diameter of that area, but I have run into difficulties from the segmentation stage.<br>
What process should I go through?</p>
