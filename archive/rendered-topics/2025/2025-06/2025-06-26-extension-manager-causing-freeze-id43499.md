<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>I have an issue with a fresh install of Slicer 5.8.1 on a PC running Windows 10 Enterprise. After install, I opened the extension manager once to successfully install one module (SurfaceWrapSolidify). Every time following, when I try to open extension manager Slicer freezes (the extension manager window won’t even pop up). There are no errors or pop-ups. I always have to force kill the program. I’ve tried fresh installs which haven’t fixed the issue.</p>
<p>Slicer and the extension manager run fine on the other account on this PC.</p>
<p>I welcome any troubleshooting advice.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Can you elaborate here?  What account works and what doesn’t, is one an admin account and the other one restricted somehow?</p>
<p>Also could you try <a href="https://slicer-packages.kitware.com/#collection/5f4474d0e1d8c75dfc70547e/folder/5f4474d0e1d8c75dfc705482">some older versions</a> to see if this is something new.</p>
