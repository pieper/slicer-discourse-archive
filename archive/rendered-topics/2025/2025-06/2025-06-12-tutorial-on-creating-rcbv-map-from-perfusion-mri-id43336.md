<p>Hello,</p>
<p>While I am fairly certain that 3DSlicer can do what I need, I am a bit lost on where to find information on how to do it.</p>
<p>I have a series of 950 slides of Perfusion MRI data. As I understand it, I must convert this into a MultiVolume and then use that to create the rCBV map with the DSCMRIAnalysis extension.</p>
<p>I haven’t been able to find tutorials on how to do this. Could someone outline the steps for me for how to go from the 950 slide perfusion series to creating the rCBV map? I am fairly new to 3DSlicer so any information is welcome. That would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Thank you very much.</p>
<p>Samuel.</p>
