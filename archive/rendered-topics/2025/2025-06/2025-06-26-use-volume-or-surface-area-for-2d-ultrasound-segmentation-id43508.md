<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have segmented my ROI of 2D ultrasound images, and confused on how to measure the surface area of my segmentation.</p>
<p>I exported a Segment Statistics table that includes Voxel Count, Volume (mm3), and Surface area (mm2). My assumption was that the Surface Area (mm2) measure would simply give me the surface area of my segmentation, based on the documents on the Slicer website. However, I am receiving some mixed inputs from peers and internet resources, and would appreciate if someone could clear my confusion.</p>
<p>I’m also curious as to why the volume and surface area values would be different for a 2D segmentation. Assuming the depth of the segment is 1 mm (given that it’s 2D), shouldn’t the formula for calculating volume and surface area yield the same result?</p>
<p>For example, one of my segments has the following properties:<br>
Voxel Count: 164574<br>
Volume [mm3]: 691.31<br>
Surface area [mm2]: 1900.42</p>
<p>This is all quite new to me, so I would greatly appreciate some clarity. Thank you.</p>
