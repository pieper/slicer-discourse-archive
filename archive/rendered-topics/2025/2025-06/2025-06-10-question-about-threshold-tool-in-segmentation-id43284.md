<p>I have a question regarding the threshold tool in segmentation. When I set the threshold value, several segments appear merged together in one segment. I would like to separate each of them into individual segments. Could you please advise me on how to do that?</p>

<p>Many options. 1. lower the threshold if they are really not connected. 2. Use the scissors tool 3. etc etc</p>
