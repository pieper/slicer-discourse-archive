<p>Hi everyone<br>
I have two DICOM CT images (CT1, CT2) (Matrix size: 512,512,111) that I want to register them with B spline deformable registration module. I have also exported a  RT dose file  (RT2) (Matrix size:100,61,1) from the treatment planning system. I want to apply the transformation matrix of this registration to the RT dose file. But I don’t know how can I do it.<br>
1- Can you help me how to do this?<br>
2- Do I need to change the size of the RT dose file in general?</p>
<p>Tanks a lot</p>
