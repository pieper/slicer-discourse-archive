<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>We are thrilled to announce that based on popular demand following the <a href="https://discourse.slicer.org/t/talk2view-the-medical-viewer-you-can-talk-to-built-on-3d-slicer/43423">release of our Talk2View desktop application</a> last week, we have now released Talk2View as an extension for 3D Slicer. This means that 3D Slicer users can use Talk2View within their existing environment by simply downloading and installing the Talk2View extension from our website <a href="http://www.talk2view.com" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">www.talk2view.com</a>. Thank you to <a class="mention" href="/u/sam_horvath">@Sam_Horvath</a>, <a class="mention" href="/u/jcfr">@jcfr</a> and <a class="mention" href="/u/pieper">@pieper</a> who helped make this happen.</p>
<p>To try it out:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to our website <a href="http://www.talk2view.com" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">www.talk2view.com</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://talk2view.com/auth" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Sign up</a> with your email address to create a new Talk2View account.</li>
<li><a href="https://talk2view.com/download" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Download</a> the Talk2View extension for 3D Slicer.</li>
<li>Open the <strong>Extension Manager</strong> in your existing 3D Slicer installation.</li>
<li>Click on <strong>Install from file…</strong>.</li>
<li>Select the <code>Talk2View-gitc2d7fbd-2025-06-27.zip</code> file downloaded in the step above and click <strong>Open</strong>.</li>
<li>Restart 3D Slicer.</li>
<li>In the new Talk2View panel that should appear on the right hand side of the 3D Slicer interface, enter your email address and password, and click <strong>Login</strong>.</li>
<li>In the Talk2View module, select a sample data set and click <strong>Download</strong>.</li>
<li>After the data has been loaded into 3D Slicer, you can start interacting with Aimelia, the Talk2View assistant, to explore, manipulate and learn about the data that is displayed.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is what it should look like:</p>
<p><img src="https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXcGFKQwpBS3lrgZYNH14Edm70RdG4M6pW7yfGDditEPxJD6P1eD7aAk-ZN3EugKrWacWn-PSr27CoslZT4JPFy2s5uzX3KkPMO3OBngjm_ct3M_z5CzLcOUSuXJugxWsy9m-EpbvQ?key=3Nvwn3CL0LOG7yVwbZNkYQ" alt="" width="624" height="384" role="presentation"></p>
<p>Below are some example prompts to try.</p>
<p>For the brain atlas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Show only the diencephalon (thanks <a class="mention" href="/u/rkikinis">@rkikinis</a>).</li>
<li>List all the segments I can see.</li>
<li>Show only the gray matter.</li>
<li>What are the red things I can see?</li>
<li>Teach me about each part of the brain one by one.</li>
<li>Show only the eyes.</li>
<li>Show everything that is connected to the eyes.</li>
<li>Show everything that is connected functionally to the eyes.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the other atlases:</p>
<ul>
<li>Show only the bones</li>
<li>Show only the blood vessels</li>
<li>Show the veins only</li>
<li>Show the lungs and the arteries connected to the lungs only</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course this should all work for other data sets loaded into 3D Slicer as well.</p>
