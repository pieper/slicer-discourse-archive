<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have been working on a project for a while now, and starting around two weeks ago, I have suddenly had problems getting DICOM files that I previously imported into the Slicer database (and was able to load normally) to display without crashing the application (on Windows). This has happened with both release 5.8.0 and 5.8.1. I am looking for some guidance on troubleshooting this issue, thank you in advance.</p>

<p>Are the files saved on OneDrive (or maybe Dropbox?). There can be problems with that.</p>

<p>Ah, good to know, I assume that is the problem then. I am accessing them from Box Drive.</p>
