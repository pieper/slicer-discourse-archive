<p>Hey guys,<br>
I recently startet using slicer 3D and have the task of do measurements of the pulp chamber in a study model (in vitro model with extracted canines).<br>
Does anyone have experiences of marking and measuring the pulp or other structures in this software? Maybe with the opportunity of marking/separating each tooth and measuring each tooth? Segmentation with dentalsegmentor was not successfull.<br>
Thanks for help!</p>
