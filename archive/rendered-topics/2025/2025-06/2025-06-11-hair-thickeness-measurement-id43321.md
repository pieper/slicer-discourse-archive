<p>Hello all, I am a hair researcher and a newbie to Slicer3D.<br>
I came to know Slicer3D from the article entitled “Clinical efficacy and safety of low‐dose oral minoxidil versus topical solution in the improvement of androgenetic alopecia: A randomized controlled trial - Asilian - 2024 - Journal of Cosmetic Dermatology - Wiley Online Library”<br>
<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jocd.16086" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jocd.16086</a><br>
The authors mentioned they used Slicer3D to measure hair strand thickness from trichoscopic images (like my sample photos attached).<br>
I couldn’t find any instructions or tutorials regarding this use case, so I would be grateful if fellow members might guide me to how to measure hair thickeness.<br>
Thank you</p>
