<p>This is a cross-post from <a href="https://discourse.kitware.com/t/access-to-main-cxx-from-custom-slicer-python-application/1524" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Kitware discourse topic</a>.</p>
<p>Essentially, I’m interested in understanding to what I have access in Main.cxx (Qt, etc.) and how I would reference, from the custom Python application, something I have implemented at the .cxx level.</p>
