<p>Wrap Solidify was working very well for shrinkwrapping my models, but now suddenly it has started only making either very boxy segments (carve holes set at 35mm or higher) or tiny fragments (carve holes set at 34mm or lower).</p>
<p>Is there a setting I might have changed by mistake? All the advanced Wrap Solidify settings are still at their defaults.</p>

<p>Is the segmentation chunky when you use the Paint effect (with “Sphere brush” mode), too?</p>

<p>Thank you for responding! No, paint with sphere brush is acting as usual</p>

<p>Then probably it is due to wrap solidify parameter settings. It is hard to guess withiut knowing more. If you can share your scene (upload somewhere and post the link here) or post screenshots of both the effect parameters and how the mesh looks before and after then we may be able to five advice. You may also join the weekly developer meeting to show it quickly and get tips on what to change.</p>
