<p>Previously in version 5.6.2 this:<br>
self.SegmentID = Segmentation.GetSegmentIdBySegmentName(segment_name)<br>
retrieved the segmentID</p>
<p>In version 5.8.2, it returns none.<br>
Is that normal? What is the new equivalent for getting the segment ID in v 5.8.1?<br>
Thanks!</p>

<p>In fact, I think it is unrelated finally. In v 5.8.1, segment name is not by default the name as the segment ID in v 5.6.2 as I understand! thanks</p>
