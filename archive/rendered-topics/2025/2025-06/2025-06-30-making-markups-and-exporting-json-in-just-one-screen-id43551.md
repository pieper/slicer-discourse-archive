<p>Hello, I would like to build a module so that there is a screen where the person presses a button and the image loads, he makes the markings and presses a button to save the labels.<br>
But before doing the module, I want to know if there is anything that has been done before, to help me and speed up the process.</p>

<p>If you can explain how this is different from the user clicking “Load Data” to load the image, and use the Markups, and then clicking “Save As” to save the markup, we can guide you better.</p>
<p>But in general what you ask is possible. Not sure how it would be an improvement over the existing functionality of loading/saving data.</p>
