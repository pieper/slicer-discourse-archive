<p>Hi!<br>
I really like the TotalSegmentator extension in 3D Slicer. As of now, I’m trying to segment the stomach after gastric sleeve surgery. This surgery results in a smaller stomach with a different shape and this leads to TotalSegmentator not being able to segment it correctly.<br>
Is there a way I can alter the TotalSegmentator script/settings to be able to segment the stomach better?</p>
