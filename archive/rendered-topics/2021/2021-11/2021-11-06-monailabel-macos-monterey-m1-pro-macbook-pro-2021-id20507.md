<p>MonaiLabel is only available from the ExtensionsManager when using latest Slicer Preview. It is not available when using Slicer stable 4.11.20210226.</p>
<p>Did you try to install using latest Slicer preview and it fail to install? Or did you not find it in the ExtensionsManager because you were using Slicer 4.11.20210226?</p>

<p>Yes I installed the stable version therefore not found in ExtensionManager. I will install Slicer Preview and see what happens</p>
