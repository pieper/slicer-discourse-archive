<p>Hi Everyone, I’ve been holding out for years to upgrading to Mac OS Catalina from Mojave, because I have several 32-bit apps that I haven’t wanted to lose access to. I’m at the point where other apps are no longer becoming compatible with Mojave and I think I have to upgrade. Does Slicer work well with Catalina now? I’m the latest stable version of Slicer.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
<p>Jamie</p>

<p>I’m a relatively slow and conservative upgrader myself, so I feel your pain. I’m on Big Sur (11.6) now, I was on Catalina for quite a while using stable (occasionally) and nightly (regularly). No major issues to speak of.</p>

<p>Yes in the latest Slicer stable documentation, the latest public release of macOS is recommended.</p>
<p><a href="https://slicer.readthedocs.io/en/v4.11/user_guide/getting_started.html#operating-system-versions" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://slicer.readthedocs.io/en/v4.11/user_guide/getting_started.html#operating-system-versions</a></p>
<p>As you’ve experienced with macOS Mojave (10.14), it is now unsupported as of October 2021 as indicated on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS_Mojave" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">macOS Mojave wikipedia page</a>. Slicer dependencies frequently only continue to support operating system versions that are themselves supported. So Slicer itself will drop support for macOS 10.14 and older as well.</p>
<p>Many IT departments only support operating system versions that are themselves supported. For macOS this is typically the current version and 2 older versions. Therefore that currently means supported versions include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>macOS Monterey (12.x) released Oct 2021</li>
<li>macOS Big Sur (11.x) released Nov 2020</li>
<li>macOS Catalina (10.15) released Oct 2019</li>
</ul>
