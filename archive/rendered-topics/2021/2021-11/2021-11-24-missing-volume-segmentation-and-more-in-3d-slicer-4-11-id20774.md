<p>I just downloaded 3D slicer (4.11.) When doing a tutorial I see that I miss several options in segmentation. I tried to install the extension segment editor extra effects, but this did not help. Is there something I can do to fix this?</p>

<p>Which function do you miss exactly?  Is it the “Segment Editor” you are referring to and the function miss is there? There is also a (different) “Segmentations” module and a “Volume rendering” module in your Slicer version.</p>
<p>Type your search text into the module finder, which opens if you press the magnifier symbol.<br>
