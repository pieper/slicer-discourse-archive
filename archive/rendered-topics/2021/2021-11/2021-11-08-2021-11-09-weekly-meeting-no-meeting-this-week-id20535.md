<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>There will be no meeting tomorrow, as it is the first Project Week meeting for the upcoming winter project week: <a href="https://discourse.slicer.org/t/reminder-project-week-36-prep-meetings-start-tomorrow-nov-9th/20534" class="inline-onebox">Reminder: Project Week 36 prep meetings start tomorrow (Nov 9th)</a></p>
<p>During the project week meeting we will discuss how the developer meeting will be scheduled going forward for the next weeks.</p>
<p>Thanks<br>
Sam and J-Christophe</p>
