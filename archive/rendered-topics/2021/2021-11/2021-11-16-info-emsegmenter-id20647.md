<p>Hi, I’m going to use 3D-Slicer for the first time. Where I can find in the last versions (I installed Slicer-4.11.20210226) the equivalent of EMSegmenter that I can find it in version 3.6.3?<br>
Thanks</p>

    All classic automatic segmentation methods (that were developed in the last few decades) have been abandoned and all efforts are directed to make deep learning based methods work. Even when limitations of this new approach will become apparent, it is very unlikely that classic methods, such as the EM segmenter, would ever return, as computing infrastructure, skills of researchers, familiarity of clinicians, and investment of companies and hospitals will all make the landscape more favorable for …

<p>Read the <a href="https://discourse.slicer.org/t/emsegmentation-cannot-found/5222" class="inline-onebox">Emsegmentation cannot found</a> thread for previous suggestions on alternative methods now that EMSegment has been removed. After trying these methods you are still unsure, please provide information here regarding the types of things you are looking to segment.</p>
