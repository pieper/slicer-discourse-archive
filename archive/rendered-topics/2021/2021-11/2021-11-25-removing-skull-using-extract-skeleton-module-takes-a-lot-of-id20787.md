<p>Extract Skeleton module is for extracting centerline from thin tubular-shaped structures.</p>
<p>You can remove the skull from MRI images using skull stripping modules, such as the <a href="https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/Nightly/Modules/SwissSkullStripper">Swiss Skull Stripper</a>.</p>

<p>Any reason the organization doesn’t own both <a href="http://slicer.org" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">slicer.org</a> and <a href="http://3dslicer.org" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">3dslicer.org</a>? Looks like <a href="http://Slicer.org" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Slicer.org</a> was created in 1999 and <a href="http://3dslicer.org" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">3dslicer.org</a> was created just recently on 2021-11-09. Info obtained from <a href="https://lookup.icann.org/lookup" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">ICANN Lookup</a>.</p>

<p>Good luck with <a href="http://3dslicer.org" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">3dslicer.org</a>. It’s parked by Transure Enterprise Ltd. They’ve got complaints against them ranging from Bank of America to BHP Billiton.</p>
