<p>I have a couple, probably, stupid questions, but I was wondering how you import a typical  model file programmatically in python into 3D Slicer, how to access/display the point cloud and wire mesh from the model for display, and finally how to programmatically get a list or sequence of the points from a point cloud or model?</p>
