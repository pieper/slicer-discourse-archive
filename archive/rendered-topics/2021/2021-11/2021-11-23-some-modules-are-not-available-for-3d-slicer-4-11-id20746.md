<p>There are almost 200 extensions that you can install that add more modules. Modules change, go away, and new modules replace them, so if you see tutorials or documentation from 5-10 years ago then you may not be able to find those modules anymore.</p>
<p>If you describe what you want to do then we can recommend modules/extensions for those in the current Slicer version.</p>
