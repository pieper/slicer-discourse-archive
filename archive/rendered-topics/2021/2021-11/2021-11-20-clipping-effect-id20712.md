<p>It depends. Which artifacts causing you trouble - patient motion (blurring and random gray streaks) or beam hardening (bright streaks due to presence of metal)? What is the clinical application (evaluation of bone density for implant planning, surgical planning, orthodontics,…)? What is your main region of interest - what do you need to visualize, measure, or segment accurately? The best would be if you could post illustrative images.</p>
