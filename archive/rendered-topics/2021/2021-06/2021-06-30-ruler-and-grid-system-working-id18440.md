<p>Hello. I am currently trying to understand the code of slicer and got stuck at how ruler and grid system works here.</p>
<p>I understand that there are three text types for ruler and according to that, the ruler get displayed. But I cannot understand that how actually these features works. What things happens at backend. Can anyone please help me to understand that? <a class="mention" href="/u/lassoan">@lassoan</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/pieper">@pieper</a></p>

<p>I don’t think anyone would want to write or maintain design documentation at such low level, but you can have a look at the source code and maybe run the Slicer in a debugger to see how it works exactly. We can also help with any specific questions that you may have.</p>
