<p>The topic was closed, probably by the user. There was a duplicate post from the same user that now I don’t see. As a new user he also had to wait for his post to be approved. I think people get a message that their message is waiting for approval, but it happens that people try to post new messages and then they start to delete them when they realize they just need to wait. I unlock the message to allow us to communicate with him.</p>
