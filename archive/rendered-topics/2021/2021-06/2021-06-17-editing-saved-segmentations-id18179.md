<p>When opening a saved segmentation scene and trying to edit it with the segment editor, the error message: “AttributeError: ‘NoneType’ object has no attribute 'GetNumberOfValues” appears.<br>
Has anyone else experienced this error and knows how to deal with it?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Could you post the complete application log here?</p>
<p>What Slicer version did you use to create the scene and what Slicer version do open it with now?</p>
