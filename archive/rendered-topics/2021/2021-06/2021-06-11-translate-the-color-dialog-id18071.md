<p>Which color dialog is this? It looks like a standard dialog. If you use native dialog (provided by the operating system) then you need to change the operating system language. If you use a Qt dialog then you can change it by using standard Qt internationalization methods. I have not worked on internationalization, so I cannot provide more details, but web search for <code>Qt color dialog translation</code> should give you useful hints.</p>
<p>Let us know what you have found because if we receive the funding that we applied for (for translating Slicer) then this information will be useful. We will get to know the result late July.</p>
