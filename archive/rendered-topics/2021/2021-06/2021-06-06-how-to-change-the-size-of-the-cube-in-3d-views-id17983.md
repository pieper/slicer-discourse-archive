<p>Hi.<br>
I’m new in 3D Slicer.<br>
I’m also have an issue with the cube in 3D view,<br>
The cube is bigger (way bigger) that my 3D sequence model, this makes difficult to work with .stl transformations.</p>
<p>How make the purple smaller to fit the 3D image?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>In latest Slicer Preview Release, the cube size is set to the size of the first model that you load. But you can always reset it to the current view content by clicking the <a href="https://slicer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/user_interface.html#d-view">“reset field of view” button</a>.</p>
