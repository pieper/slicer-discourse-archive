<p>Hi,</p>
<p>To the best of my knowledge, segment segmentation is not yet possible in 3D Slicer. You can separate lung lobes reliably with the “Interactive Lobe Segmentation” module within the Chest Imaging Platform (CIP). There is an airway segmentation extension in CIP, but it seems as if it has not been updated to new Slicer versions for a longer period.</p>
<p>Best regards</p>
