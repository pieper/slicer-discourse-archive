<p>hello sir. I am really stuck at one point. I loaded png images (more than 5000 images) and converted them to .tif format (which was successful). then i copied 1600 images out of this folder in another folder and tried to load png images and convert to .tif (as i want multiple of 64 images for my CNN program) but it’s not getting loaded in slicer. kindly guide, i have been trying from long time. same images but not getting loaded.</p>

<p>How are you loading them now?  Maybe you can try <a href="https://github.com/SlicerMorph/S_2020/blob/master/Day_1/ImageStacks/ImageStacks.md">ImageStacks</a> instead.</p>
