<p>I’m currently working on a <a href="https://github.com/Slicer/Slicer/pull/5325" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Markups update</a> and would like to get some feedback. One change planned is to rename the “Persistent” mode something more intuitive.</p>
<p>A couple options suggested include a checkbox to enable “Place multiple” or “Multiple measurements” mode.</p>
<p>As an alternative, the persistent mode could be made the default, with a checkbox to enable “Place single” or “Single measurement” mode. With <a href="https://discourse.slicer.org/t/feedback-requested-requirements-to-place-a-fiducial/18407">rotations now allowed in persistence mode</a> and new menubar/keyboard shortcuts added in this update to end placement mode, toggling in and out of placement mode is simpler and needed less frequently.</p>
<p>Feedback on these or other suggestions would be very helpful.</p>

<p>I agree, <code>Persistent</code> isn’t really the right word here.  I do like the idea of making it the default, so that Markups mouse modes work like window/level for instance.  I was also thinking that having the Escape key bring you back to normal mouse mode would make sense.</p>
