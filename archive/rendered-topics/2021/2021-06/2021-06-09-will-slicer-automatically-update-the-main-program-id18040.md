<p>Will Slicer automatically update the main program? I remember that these two functions were not available when I first installed it.<br>

<p>You enabled developer mode. Macro recorder is primarily intended as a developer tool and it is only displayed if developer mode is enabled in Application Settings.</p>
<p>Slicer does not automatically update the application. You can enable auto-update for extensions (but you still need to open the Extensions manager for that to take effect).</p>
