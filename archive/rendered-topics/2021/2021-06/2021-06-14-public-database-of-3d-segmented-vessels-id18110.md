<p>Do you know the existence of any accesible database annotated with segmented vessels in 3D?</p>
<p>I know there are a lot of private databases with vessel segmentation for AI, but wondering if there is any public initiative. I don’t care the imaging modality, I’d like to experiment with my own network for 3D images.</p>
<p>About the size of the database, before any data augmentation, how many annotated images would be reasonable OK for training?</p>
