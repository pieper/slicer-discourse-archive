<p>It is my distinct pleasure to announce that we have been awarded an Essential Open Source Software for Science (EOSS) grant from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI), a philanthropy led by Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and his wife Dr. Priscilla Chan. The grant will support the new “3D Slicer in My Language” project to increase the accessibility of 3D Slicer in non-English speaking countries. We are thrilled to start developing a French version of 3D Slicer in collaboration with Cheikh Anta Diop University in Senegal thanks to the award. In the future, we plan to translate 3D Slicer to other languages to empower members of the global Slicer community to analyze their own data in their own language.</p>

<p>Hi, spujol,</p>
<p>The 3D slicer in My Language project is interesting!<br>
What is the current status of this project?<br>
I am a Japanese, so I can help you to translate strings to Japanese language.<br>
Multi-byte character sometimes cause problems like it does not work with paths including multi-byte characters. When you complete the project, I can strongly recommend 3D slicer to my colleagues and friends.</p>
<p>thank you,</p>

<p><strike>We have created a project on Crowdin for translating Slicer. Anybody can register a user at <a href="http://crowdin.com">crowdin.com</a> and start submitting translations for the <strong><a href="https://crowdin.com/project/slicer">Slicer project</a></strong>. Please give it a try and let us know how things work. Probably these translations will be available for Slicer Preview Release users in a few weeks.</strike> <em>Update: We use Weblate for managing the translations - see details <a href="https://discourse.slicer.org/t/czi-essential-open-source-software-for-science-eoss-award-for-3d-slicer-internationalization/19500/19">below</a>.</em></p>
<p>For anyone interested in technical details of where the translations are stored and how language packs will be generated, see <a href="https://discourse.slicer.org/t/slicer-translation-workflow-using-crowdin/21601">this discussion</a>.</p>

<p>hi <a class="mention" href="/u/cyufu">@cyufu</a> !  Thank you for joining the conversation.  I see there is some Chinese being contributed to crowdin and that you have an account there now.  Would be willing to serve a proofreader to approve proposed translations?  It will be very helpful to build on your experience.</p>

## Post #16 by @cyufu (2022-01-25 23:06 UTC)

<p>3DSlicer is my favorite software and I would love to do the job.</p>

## Post #17 by @pieper (2022-01-26 00:00 UTC)

<p>Excellent!  I changed your crowdin account to be a proofreader so I think that should let you approve the proposed translations.  Thank you!</p>

<p>Hi, all</p>
<p>I finished to translate the strings into Japanese words.<br>
I did all of that on Weblate website. Is that OK?</p>

## Post #20 by @lassoan (2022-08-30 19:46 UTC)

<p>We noticed your extensive contributions! Thanks a lot for your hard work.</p>
<p>We are improving the translation infrastructure so that more and more parts of the application can be translated and users can enable localized user interface more easily, but we rely on enthusiastic contributors like you for the actual translation.</p>
