<p>It means that the segmentation server is unavailable. Have you set up your own server or using the default Slicer segmentation server?</p>

<p>The default server is available now, but if you want to set up your own then follow the instructions <a href="https://docs.nvidia.com/clara/clara-train-sdk/aiaa/index.html">here</a>.</p>
