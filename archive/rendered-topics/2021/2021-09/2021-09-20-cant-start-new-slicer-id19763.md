<p>^ Based on the linked 3D Slicer system requirements, Windows 10 is the minimum supported version for latest versions of 3D Slicer. As shown in your video, you are using Windows 7.  Windows 7 went <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/windows/end-of-windows-7-support" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">End-of-Life</a> on January 14th, 2020 so it is no longer a version being tested for Slicer and development resources will not be provided to fixing issues associated with that version.</p>

    Windows 7 is not supported (Microsoft dropped support for it long time ago). We have not made any breaking changes intentionally, but we don’t test impact of changes on these old systems. It is not very likely that you can get help from the community to troubleshoot this, so if running Slicer on Windows7 is a priority for you and you cannot resolve the problem yourself then you may contract <a href="https://slicer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/about.html#commercial-partners" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">commercial partners</a> to investigate the issue.
