<p>Hi Guys,<br>
Unable to get fill between slices when slices are created on a reformatted volume. Is there a way to do it? would be very helpful.<br>

<p>Fill between slices algorithm does not work on oblique slices.</p>
<p>You can review <a href="https://lassoan.github.io/SlicerSegmentationRecipes/ObliqueSliceSegmentation/" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Overview | 3D Slicer segmentation recipes</a> for possible alternatives though.</p>
