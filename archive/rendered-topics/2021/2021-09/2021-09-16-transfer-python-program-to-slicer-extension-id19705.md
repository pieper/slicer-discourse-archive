<p>Hello everyone. I am new to Slicer and I have coded the Python program that can store the Tag of a DICOM file as a csv file. Now I want to develop a simple slicer extension that will start running that Python program at the press of a button. How should I do it? Are there any good related resources I can refer to?</p>
