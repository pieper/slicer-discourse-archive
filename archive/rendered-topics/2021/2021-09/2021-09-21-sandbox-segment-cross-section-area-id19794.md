<p>I am new to using 3d slicer. I would like to use the segment cross-section area tool. From what I understand, I need to install the sandbox extension. I have gone through all the extensions listed in the extension manager but can’t seem to find the sandbox. I have watched a couple of tutorial videos—in those videos when you search for sandbox it shows up in the examples, but when I search for it nothing comes up. Is this extension still available? If not, is there another method for calculating CSA in slicer.</p>
<p>I’m using 4.11.20210226 mac version.</p>

<p>Ok, figured it out. I downloaded the preview version—it has the sandbox extension.</p>

<p>Sorry for the slow reply. Yes, you should be using the latest preview unless there is an overriding reason to use 4.11 (somewhat uncommon).</p>
