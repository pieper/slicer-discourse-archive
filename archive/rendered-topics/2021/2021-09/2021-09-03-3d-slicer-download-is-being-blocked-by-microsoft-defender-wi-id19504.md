<p>I know this is not right but I have to ask is the download safe for 3d slicer I am being blocked by Microsoft windows 10 Defender is gives me the option to Report the file as safe i have no idea how many people get this far and then just hit delete , just let me know maybe if enough people Reported it safe this Block would go away.</p>

<p>Signing the app binary is a manual process so we only do it for the stable releases so those install without a warning.  For the nightly preview builds you need to click “more info” and then “Run anyway”.</p>
