<p>Hey guys,</p>
<p>I’ve got two models.</p>
<p>They have been registered on 3D Slicer with CMFReg.</p>
<p>A SPHARM mesh has been generated for each using SlicerSalt. So far so good.</p>
<p>How do I go about automatically identifying corresponding points or regions on the two models? Pick n Paint module on 3D Slicer has the “Propagation” option which looks promising, but I click it and it does nothing.</p>
<p>Any advice or guide in the right direction will be much appreciated.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>
<p>Dan</p>
