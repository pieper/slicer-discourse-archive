<p>We would like to try Monai/MonaiLabel to segment mouse fetuses which are scanned via contrast-enhanced microCT . I don’t think any of the existing models will be relevant for us. How does one go developing a model from scratch?</p>
<p>We do have some manually labeled data. Pointers will be much appreciated.<br>

<p>I would recommend to start by following instructions on the <a href="https://github.com/Project-MONAI/MONAILabel">MONAILabel project website</a>. When you get stuck, <a href="https://github.com/Project-MONAI/MONAILabel#community">contact the MONAILabel Community</a> - describe what is your goal and how far you got. It would be great if you could keep us posted about your progress here.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you may try to get into the <a href="https://www.gpuhackathons.org/event/monai-miccai-bootcamp-2021">3-day MONAI Bootcamp</a>. The application deadline was yesterday but maybe they can still make an exception.</p>
