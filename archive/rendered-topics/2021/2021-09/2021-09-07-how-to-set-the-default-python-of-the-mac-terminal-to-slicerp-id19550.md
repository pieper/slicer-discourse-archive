<p>You can set the path in your shell (search for <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11530090/adding-a-new-entry-to-the-path-variable-in-zsh">things like this</a>).  The path would be to wherever you installed Slicer, e.g. <code> /Applications/Slicer.app/Contents/bin</code>.  Or you could make an alias so that whatever command you want is translated to <code> /Applications/Slicer.app/Contents/bin/PythonSlicer</code>.</p>
