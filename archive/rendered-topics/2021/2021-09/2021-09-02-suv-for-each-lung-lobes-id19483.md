<p>Hi! How can I measure SUV for each lung lobe?<br>
I couldn’t do it with Chest Imaging Platform + SUV computation</p>

<p>What did you do exactly, what did you expect to happen, and what happened instead?</p>

<p>input data: lung perfusion with Tc99-MAA SPECT/CT<br>
segmented the lobes of the lungs with the CIP, then I wanted to count SUV in each lobe with StandartUptakeValueComputation.</p>
