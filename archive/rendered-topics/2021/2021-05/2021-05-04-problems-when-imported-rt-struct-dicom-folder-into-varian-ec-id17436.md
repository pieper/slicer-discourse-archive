<p>Dear authors,<br>
I have recently asked you guys about how to export to a segmentation nifti files into RT-Struct by python script and i was able to do it thanks to your instructions. But now, i’m facing new problems.<br>
<strong>When i took the folder which was output by 3D Slicer to Varian Eclipse, i got a tons of error which was showed as below</strong><br>
<div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69883752/116051395-c0884180-a6a2-11eb-88fa-657da488ccb6.png" title="image" rel="noopener nofollow ugc"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69883752/116051395-c0884180-a6a2-11eb-88fa-657da488ccb6.png" alt="image" width="690" height="347"><div class="meta">
<svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#far-image"></use></svg><span class="filename">image</span><span class="informations">1547×780</span><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#discourse-expand"></use></svg>
</div></a></div>.<br>
<strong>And here is also the result when imported Auto_SS ( Segmentation rt-struct file which was created by 3D Slicer)</strong><br>
<div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69883752/116052410-c9c5de00-a6a3-11eb-9700-a166f811dd37.png" title="image" rel="noopener nofollow ugc"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69883752/116052410-c9c5de00-a6a3-11eb-9700-a166f811dd37.png" alt="image" width="690" height="241"><div class="meta">
<svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#far-image"></use></svg><span class="filename">image</span><span class="informations">1497×524</span><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#discourse-expand"></use></svg>
</div></a></div><br>
Can you show me how to deal with these problems ?<br>
Hope you reply me soon.</p>
