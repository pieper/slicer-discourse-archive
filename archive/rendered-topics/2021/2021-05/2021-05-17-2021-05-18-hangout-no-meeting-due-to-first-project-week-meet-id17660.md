<p>We will NOT be having the weekly dev meeting tomorrow, as the <a href="https://discourse.slicer.org/t/reminder-project-week-35-preparation-meetings-starting-tomorrow/17659">first Project Week meeting</a> is at the same time.  The Slicer dev team will be at the Project Week meeting, where we will discuss how we will handle scheduling of the dev hangout during Project week prep.  Feel free to reply to this topic with ideas / requests for scheduling.  We will likely end up doing a short dev meeting before or after the weekly Project Week prep call.</p>
<p>Thanks<br>
Sam and J-Christophe</p>
