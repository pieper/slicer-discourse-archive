<p>Since I last was involved with Slicer, the new MacM1 platform has appeared (and 32bit Mac app support dropped in OS). How does Slicer support the dual Intel/Arm architecture? Did Slicer already have Arm support for Linux systems?</p>

<p>Users reported that current x64 Slicer releases work fine on M1, so we don’t plan to change anything in the short term. If all the underlying libraries (mainly Qt and VTK) will support Arm natively then we may consider creating native Arm releases.</p>
