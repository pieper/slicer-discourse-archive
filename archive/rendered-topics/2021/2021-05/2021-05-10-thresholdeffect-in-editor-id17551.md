<p>Hi,<br>
I am using 3D Slicer to make models out of micro-CT png. files.<br>
Therefore I am using the Editor module. After I chose a certain threshold in the “ThresholdEffect”, I go to the “MakeModelEffect” and create the model.<br>
My question is: Is there any way to find out the threshold I used in the “ThresholdEffect”, after the model is done?<br>
I would appreciate any kind of advice!</p>

<p>Please use latest Slicer Stable Release or latest Slicer Preview Release and Segment Editor module. It includes all features of the legacy Editor module and model maker. See more information <a href="https://slicer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/image_segmentation.html">here</a>.</p>
