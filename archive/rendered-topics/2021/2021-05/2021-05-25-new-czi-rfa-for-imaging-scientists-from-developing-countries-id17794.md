<p>I think this might be an excellent opportunity for some of Slicer’s users/developers in developing countries. See RFA here: <a href="https://chanzuckerberg.com/rfa/expanding-global-access-bioimaging/?utm_campaign=Science&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsmi=128537837&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8yp3eAZXnLMwkng7ze_OyeehNEDtpZl5IJcg7NzYhIlxWzBC1snqpG_BWrpsd5xGDh3qIMDA-3LkSOqVzeqWV4XmDhbw&amp;utm_content=128537837&amp;utm_source=hs_email" class="inline-onebox">New Funding Opportunity to Expand Global Access to Bioimaging</a></p>
