<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am looking for a straightforward tutorial for downloading the SlicerVMTK extension as I do not have a computer science background.</p>
<p>All tutorials found online involve the usage of python and while it may be a simple task to perform, my lack of background knowledge is holding me back. If anyone knows of a tutorial or would be able to walk me through it that would be great.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance</p>
