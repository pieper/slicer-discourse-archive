<p>Hello everybody,<br>
Can anyone help me with the procrust allignment in slicer. After running Spharm modeling, I don’t know which file in the output folder( paratospharesh) should be used as the registration template? I tried using surfSHARM.vtk file and ellalign file as Reg Template, then run analyse again, but I could not get procrust alligned file.<br>
Could someone please help me out?</p>
