<p>Operating system: Window10<br>
Slicer version: 4.11</p>
<p>I am a newbie in 3D slicer. I would like to calculate the airway diameter in the lung at each generation. Is there a simple way to implement it? I see the chest imaging platform, and there are many sub-functions. I presume/hope one of them would do it.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>CIP should be able to do it, but I don’t know it well, so I cannot help you with specifics. You can also get the diameters using VMTK extension’s Extract Centerline module.</p>
