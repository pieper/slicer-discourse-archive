<p>Hi,</p>
<p>when I click on Edit (attached screenshot), just a black screen blinks for a moment and disappears and nothing else happens.<br>
I was wondering how I can see the logs of those errors so that I can figure our how to resolve it.</p>

<p>Hi,<br>
The “Edit” button should open the python code template file of your new scripted extension. Are you on windows? Make sure that *.py files are assigned to open with your favourite text editor.<br>
