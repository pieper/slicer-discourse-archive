<p>I am working with Slicer 4.11 and 4.13. I have a stl file and want to do some modification like cut a part and add another part to it. When I open the stl file from File tab as a data, all SegmentEditor tabs are inactive. Is it possible to modify stl file? If so how?<br>
Many thanks in advance!</p>
