<p>Hi,<br>
I’d like to ask why I cannot open the 3D slicer. Until yesterday I was working normally. Today I’m trying to open it and the program does not correspond at all. I added some extentions lately but I restarted the software as it mentioned and the program operated normally.<br>
Any ideas?<br>
Thank you.</p>

<p>Probably your settings have become corrupted (because of instability caused by an extension, incorrect application shutdown due to multiple monitors, sleep mode, etc.). See troubleshooting instructions <a href="https://slicer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/get_help.html#slicer-application-does-not-start">here</a>.</p>
