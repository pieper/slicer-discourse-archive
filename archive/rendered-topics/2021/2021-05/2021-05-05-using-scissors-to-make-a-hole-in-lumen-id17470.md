<p>I am using Scissors to make a circle hole in one side of my lumen which has a hollow tube shape.The problem is when use scissors the hole is made ib both side of the lumen. Is it possible to limit this option to make a hole just in one side? and is it possible to set a diameter of hole for scissors?</p>

<p>If you draw your scissors shape on a slice view instead of on the 3D view you can limit its extent.  See the Slice Cut options.  Also, you can use the Circle shape option.</p>
