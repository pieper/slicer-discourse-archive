<p>Hi everyone, my name is Yusniel Santos Rodríguez, I am a Cuban neuroscientist and currently I work on issues related to the pre-surgical planning of brain tumors. Recently i have turned my attention to MRI perfusion imaging and i need to obtain the main statistical maps (mean transit time, cerebral blood flow, cerebral blood volume). I found that 3D Slicer had an extension called DSCMRIAnalisys, but couldn’t find it in the extension library. I would like to know if that extension still exists and where I can find it. Thank you very much for your help.</p>

<p>I’ve submitted a <a href="https://github.com/QIICR/DSC_Analysis/pull/2">fix</a> for the build errors, so probably the extension will become available in the extensions manager in 1-2 days.</p>
<p>It would be great to get your feedback about the extension - if it works and if you find it useful, because we only spend time with further maintaining and modernizing the extension if it helps users.</p>

<p>Hello everybody. Thank you very much for the effort  for making the extension available again. I will try to keep you informed of all the events during its use. To begin with, I have already been able to download the extension and install it without errors in 3d Slicer. Here I have some initial questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>To use this extension do I need a specific version of 3d Slicer? After installing the extension I could not find it in the list of active modules of the software.</li>
<li>Is there a tutorial for the use of this extension?</li>
</ol>
<p>Thank you very much for your help.</p>
