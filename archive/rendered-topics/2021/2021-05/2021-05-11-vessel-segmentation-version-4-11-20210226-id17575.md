<p>There are many vessel segmentation tutorials for Slicer on YouTube (see for example in this channel: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/PerkLabResearch/videos">https://www.youtube.com/user/PerkLabResearch/videos</a>). If contrast agent is used then extraction of larger vessels is trivial, but if no contrast was used or if you need to segment small vessels then it can be challenging. Feel free to post any specific questions that you have about segmenting your data sets.</p>
