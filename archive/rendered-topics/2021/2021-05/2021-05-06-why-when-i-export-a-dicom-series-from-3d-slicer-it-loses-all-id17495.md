<p>When I try to export a DICOM series from 3D Slicer dataset it loses all the original DICOM tags (like Study date and Time, UID, series name, series modality, etc…), Why does it work like that?<br>
Wouldn’t it be possibile for 3D Slicer to export a series identical in DICOM tags to that imported in the dataset. This is particularly an issue when I would like to export segmentations or DICOM RT structures linked to the original series, but I’m forced to exported these segmentation linked to new untagged studies.<br>
Can anybody help me?<br>
thank you very much</p>
