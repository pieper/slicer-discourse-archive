<p>While reviewing project metrics for a grant application we realized that although we have a common understanding about how to conduct operations in the Slicer community, we do not have a formalized document to describe it.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.contributor-covenant.org/">Contributor Covenant</a> is a short and clear description that captures well how we operate, so we propose to adopt this as code of conduct document for Slicer.</p>
<p>If you have any questions, comments, or suggestions, please add a comment to <a href="https://github.com/Slicer/Slicer/pull/5645">this pull request</a> till Wednesday.</p>
