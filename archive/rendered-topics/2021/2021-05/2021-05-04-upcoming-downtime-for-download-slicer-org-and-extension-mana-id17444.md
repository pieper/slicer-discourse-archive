<p>Hi all:</p>
<p>Over the next two weeks, the Slicer development team at Kitware will be transitioning to new backend servers for hosting the Slicer installer packages and extensions.  We are moving to a server built on the newer Girder platform for the backend and a vue.js based web application for the frontend.  This will address EOL issues with the infrastructure, and significantly improve the download / extension manager experience for users.</p>
<p>As a result of this ongoing upgrade, during the next <s>two weeks</s> few months, we expect there will be  some downtimes for the <a href="http://download.slicer.org">download.slicer.org</a> and the extension manager.  This post will be updated to include references to implementation details, describe how to test the new infrastructure and announce downtimes as they occur.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>JC and Sam</p>
