<p>I tried to load a 1mm brain CT image, but the software hungs. The CT mage is in nrrd file format.</p>

<p>What is the total size of the volume? How much RAM do you have?<br>
Does it work well with latest Slicer Preview Release?<br>
Can you share the data set?</p>

<p>I have 48 GB RAM.<br>
The CT volume has 512x512x256 (voxel size: 0.5x0.5x0.7)<br>
I subsampled to 256x256x128 (0.9x0.9x1.4)<br>
Both images I tested with latest SlicerSALT software, and it hungs.<br>
Both images could be loaded without problems in Slicer 4.11.20200930 in Windows 10.<br>
Yes. I could send you the image. How can I do it?</p>

<p>What is the operation during the application hangs? Loading the data or performing some special analysis?</p>
<p>You can share the data by uploading it somewhere (dropbox, onedrive, …) and post the download link here.</p>
