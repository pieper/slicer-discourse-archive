<p>This paper just came out about neurosurgery work at University College London in the UK using Slicer.</p>

<h3><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33937966/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Integrated multi-modality image-guided navigation for neurosurgery:...</a></h3>

  <p>We present an integrated open-source research platform for multi-modality IGS. The present prototype system was tailored for neurosurgery and met all minimum design requirements focused on skull base surgery. Future work aims to optimise the system...</p>

<p>They have a lot of good things to say, but I particularly liked this line:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We chose to build the system using 3D Slicer software an open-source software package with excellent documentation, enabling us to draw upon the resources of a platform with established large feature sets and a well-defined quality process.</p>
