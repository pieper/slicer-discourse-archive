<p>I guess the question is simple…</p>
<p>The only thing I could ask more is how to do it for the segmentation and how for the segment?</p>
<p>I suppose they are not the same so I guess the answer would differ.</p>

<p>Choose <strong>Jump slices</strong> in the right-click menu in any segment list (e.g., in Segment Editor or Segmentations module); or in the right-click menu of the <em>eye icon</em> of any subject hierarchy tree (e.g., in Data module).</p>
