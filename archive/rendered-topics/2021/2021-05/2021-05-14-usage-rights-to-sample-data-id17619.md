<p>I was wondering what were the usage rights to the sample datasets outside of 3DSlicer.</p>
<p>I would like to use the Full Head MRI scan for an experiment if possible. Since it is a good model, clean model and has some advantages over the Visual Human Projects. In terms of graphics processing and modeling.</p>
<p>Regards,<br>
Tom</p>
