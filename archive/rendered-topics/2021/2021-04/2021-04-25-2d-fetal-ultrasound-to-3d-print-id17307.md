<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>I’m a newbie to this forum and I’m interested in turning 2D fetal ultrasound volume into 3D STL file. The machine I use is Hitachi arietta 70 and I’ve attached the exported volume file below. I really don’t know where the problem is but I couldn’t even get a proper volume rendering of it in 3DSlicer. Can someone please help me with it? Thanks so much!</p>
