<p>I am typically loading data from .nrrd files stored as r = x (i), a = y (j), s = z (k). Ideally, I would like to orient the slice views as shown in the attached image. I can manage to accomplish this with the reformat module, however, I certainly would prefer not to have to do this each time I load a file. I had some python code in my .slicerrc.py file which used to do this for me but now does not seem to take effect.</p>
<p>Any assistance with this would be greatly appreciated!</p>
