<p>Hi</p>
<p>I often use “Resample Scalar Volume”, and think it is very useful because “Resample Image” seems not to be able to set Spacing, but “Resample Scalar Volume” can.<br>
Why was Resample Scalar Volume put into Legacy?<br>
Does it have any defects?<br>
Or, can “Resample Image” set spacing?</p>

<p>I think we marked it legacy because Crop Volume provides similar functionality as does Resample Image, but it’s true that Resample Scalar Volume has an appealing simplicity.</p>
