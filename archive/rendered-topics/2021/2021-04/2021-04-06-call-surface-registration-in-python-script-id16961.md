<p>All modules can be used from Python. <a href="https://slicer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer_guide/api.html#tutorials">Developer tutorials</a> should give you a general idea of how things work. Then, if you have questions about how to use a specific module then describe what you tried and what problems you ran into.</p>

<p><a class="mention" href="/u/robertoruizmu">@robertoruizmu</a> hi! I tried multiple things but it did not work out for me… I always get a no “hardenModelID” attribute error. Did you succeed in making a surface registration from python command with fixedModel and movingModel?</p>
<p>Thank You</p>
