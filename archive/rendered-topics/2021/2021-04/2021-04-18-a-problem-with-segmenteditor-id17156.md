When I use Threshold,as you see in this video ,After I click apply, the dyeing disappears, but it actually exists. When I click show 3D, a preview of the model appears.</p><div class="video-container">

<p>You can hide a segment in 2D views at many places. You can turn off visibility of a specific segment in a slice view, set its opacity to 0, etc. You can find these display settings in Segmentations module / Display / Advanced section. If you are not sure how to show the segment then you can upload the scene somewhere and post the link here.</p>
