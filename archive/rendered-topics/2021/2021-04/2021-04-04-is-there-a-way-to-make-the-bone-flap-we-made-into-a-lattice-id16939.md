<p>Is there a way to make the bone flap we made into a lattice pattern, or similar to this pattern, just like this picture…<img src="https://us1.discourse-cdn.com/flex002/uploads/slicer/original/3X/d/9/d9a704f9813d6242720be0e0f44475fa25306950.jpeg" alt="捕获" data-base62-sha1="v3rrOiU7GDiZf2LhjShtUdUwtz2" width="390" height="234"></p>

<p>I don’t think there’s any existing code to do that, but would be possible to do it as a dedicated development effort.</p>
