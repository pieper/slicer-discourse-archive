<p>Hello all,</p>
<p>I’ve installed 3DSlicer  for the first time for the purpose of viewing a DICOM folder for planing dental implants.</p>
<p>The installation process went ok but now when I start 3DSlicer I get this GUI: <div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://us1.discourse-cdn.com/flex002/uploads/slicer/original/3X/f/8/f8ff74f36dd6194d80f13d082032912ad5aa546f.png" data-download-href="/uploads/short-url/zwJJ2nzHYFiRCC9bLysViBUW4lV.png?dl=1" title="sc" rel="noopener nofollow ugc"><img src="https://us1.discourse-cdn.com/flex002/uploads/slicer/optimized/2X/f/f8ff74f36dd6194d80f13d082032912ad5aa546f_2_690x388.png" alt="sc" data-base62-sha1="zwJJ2nzHYFiRCC9bLysViBUW4lV" width="690" height="388" srcset="https://us1.discourse-cdn.com/flex002/uploads/slicer/optimized/2X/f/f8ff74f36dd6194d80f13d082032912ad5aa546f_2_690x388.png, https://us1.discourse-cdn.com/flex002/uploads/slicer/optimized/2X/f/f8ff74f36dd6194d80f13d082032912ad5aa546f_2_1035x582.png 1.5x, https://us1.discourse-cdn.com/flex002/uploads/slicer/optimized/2X/f/f8ff74f36dd6194d80f13d082032912ad5aa546f_2_1380x776.png 2x" data-dominant-color="69A56D"><div class="meta">

</div></a></div></p>
<p>This issue makes it impossible to use the software. Is there anything I can do to solve it? (I’ve tried redownloading and reinstalling the program and rebooting my computer but the problem persists. No other software has had any similar issues in this computer. It’s actually a reliable computer)</p>

<p>It is an intel display driver bug and updating your driver fixes the issue. If you are interested, you can find some more details in <a href="https://discourse.slicer.org/t/slicer-opening-screen-error-green-stripes/12543/17">this topic</a> and in several <a href="https://discourse.slicer.org/search?q=green%20stripes">others</a>.</p>
