Slicer version: 4.11.20200930</p>
<p>Hallo folks! Need your help!<br>
I am working with a prostatic MRI data set, my boss is  suggesting to extract a binary mask and to manually segment the prostate.<br>
He affirms I can outline 5/6 slices and then extract a mask without filling them and merge them. Is this true? Is there any way on 3D slicer?<br>
Thanks for the help!</p>
