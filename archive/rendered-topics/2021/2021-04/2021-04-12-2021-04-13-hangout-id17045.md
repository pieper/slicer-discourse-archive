<p>We should have a place to communicate the Slicer roadmap (what modules, features we plan to add/deprecate/remove). Need to find a good place for that.</p>
<ul>
<li>Wiki: Traditionally, we would put this on the wiki, but we are moving away from the wiki (not interactive enough, new users cannot register, it uses wiki markup instead of markdown, etc.).</li>
<li>ReadTheDocs: It does not really belong to the Slicer source code repository. It is planning/management document, which does not need Slicer version-specific archival (and we don’t want to see very much outdated roadmaps in old Slicer documentation). We should link to the roadmap document from readthedocs, though.</li>
<li>Discourse: We could add a new category or add just a new topic within Development. <a href="https://meta.discourse.org/t/how-to-create-a-wiki-post/30802">“Wiki” style post can be created</a> that all users with wiki editing rights can modify.</li>
<li>Google docs or Office online: This would work well while collaborating actively on a working document, but it is not well suited for long-term maintenance and discussion with a broad community.</li>
</ul>
<p>None of the options are perfect but probably a wiki-style discourse topic would work the best, because users could easily subscribe to see changes and participate in the discussions around it.</p>

<p>Agreed, some clarity and buy-in on the plans would be helpful for everyone.</p>
<p>Another option could be to use github issues for the details and then a readme.md to track the high level.  Could also use a github project to organize issues.</p>

<p>I would suggest a separate repo (so not source code) on github, because Markdown is so much easier for writing documents (if you are not anticipating a lot of figure or graphics etc).</p>
<p>Google docs is an option. If persistence and some sort of tracking is important perhaps you can consider <a href="http://OSF.io">OSF.io</a>, which offers google docs, and github integration. There are some examples here: <a href="https://osf.io/rfe6k/wiki/home/" class="inline-onebox">OSF | Curated List of OSF Example Projects Wiki</a><br>
Probably the most relevant is the working group/committee example…</p>

<p>I would advocate for embracing GitHub for more project management functionality.</p>
<ul>
<li>GitHub issues for details of individual “Add New Thing” / “Deprecate Thing”.</li>
<li>GitHub milestones to detail which things are in the near term or long term. With the new goal of quarterly stable releases, I think it would make sense to have “2021 Q1”/“2021 Q2”/“2021 Q3”/“2021 Q4” milestones that would more clearly detail what things are actively being worked on, versus will be worked on in a few months, in many many months, etc.</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.github.com/en/communities/documenting-your-project-with-wikis/about-wikis" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">GitHub Wiki</a> functionality for details regarding roadmaps. When you go to create a wiki for a repo it states:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Wikis provide a place in your repository to lay out the roadmap of your project, show the current status, and document software better, together.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can see how a mature project like Visual Studio Code use the GitHub wiki to detail their roadmap. <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/wiki/Roadmap" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/wiki/Roadmap</a>. The wiki is Markdown based. It can be updated by many people by modifying files which are contained in a separate repo. <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-wiki" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-wiki</a>.</p>

<p>Yes, I like the way VS Code does it.</p>

<p><a class="mention" href="/u/jamesobutler">@jamesobutler</a> Using the github wiki is a great idea. We could gradually move over there all Slicer version independent content from the old wiki.</p>
<p>I like the vscode roadmap, too. That project is a few magnitudes larger than Slicer, but there are some useful concepts to adopt.</p>
<p>As a test, I’ve enabled the wiki and added some content - see here:</p>
