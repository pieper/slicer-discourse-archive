<p>Operating system: Win 10<br>
Slicer version: 4.11.20210226</p>
<p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>I’ m reading a tutorial on 3DSlicer version 4.1 to learn how to use it. And it says to select the module “DWI to DTI Estimation”.<br>
But I didn’t find “DWI to DTI Estimation” in the module of my 3D slicer. I want to use the module. Did the name of the module change with the version?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
