<p>Hi I’m new to 3D slicer.</p>
<p>I have several series of DICOM data, day0,1… for each mouse.</p>
<p>Now I can use “Expert Automated Registration” to align them.</p>
<p>Then I want to crop each DICOM data with same region to calculate the change over time.</p>
<p>Which tool is appropriate for this purpose?</p>
