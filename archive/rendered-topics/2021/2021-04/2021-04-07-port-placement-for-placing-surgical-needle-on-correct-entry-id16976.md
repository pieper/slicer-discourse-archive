How to find and install port placement module, or is there any alternative to achieve the task of placing surgical needle in the beginning in correct position and angle, for needle is used here as intervention in Image Guided operation.</p>

<p>I’ve submitted a fix for PortPlacement extension’s build error. We’ll see tomorrow if it works.</p>
<p>There are many other modules for simulating port placement and checking tool trajectories. See <a href="https://discourse.slicer.org/t/how-to-do-surgical-simulation-with-slicerigt/16906/5">this post</a> for more information.</p>
