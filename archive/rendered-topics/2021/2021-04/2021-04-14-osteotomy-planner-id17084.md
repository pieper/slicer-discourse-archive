<p>The osteotomy tool is not working. I install it but the tool doesn´t appear. Someone can help me to install it properly or see the problem</p>

<p>Hi:</p>
<p>The Osteotomy Planner has been undergoing a re-write over the past few months.  The new version should be available in the nightly Preview next week.</p>
