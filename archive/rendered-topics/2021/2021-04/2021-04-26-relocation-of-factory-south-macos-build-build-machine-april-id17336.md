<p>The build machine <code>factory-south-macos.kitware</code> will be relocated to a different room this afternoon, disruption of macOS build for remaining nightly extension builds should be expected.</p>

<p>I don’t see any windows builds of extensions for stable release from today. Is this related?</p>

<p>Unrelated.  We appear to have a number of build issues today <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/frowning.png?v=9" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>

<p>The windows factory appears to have had a crash over the weekend, nightly builds will resume tomorrow.  The missing preview extensions on all platforms has also been resolved, they should also be available tomorrow.</p>
