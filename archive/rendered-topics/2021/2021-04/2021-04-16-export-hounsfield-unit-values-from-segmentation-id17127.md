<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>Is it possible to extract/export the whole set of Hounsfield Unit values from a segmentation performed via threshold tool? I want to use them for statistical purposes.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance,</p>
<p>Best,<br>
Dave.</p>

<p>You can use the Segment Statistics module or the SlicerRadiomics extension.</p>
