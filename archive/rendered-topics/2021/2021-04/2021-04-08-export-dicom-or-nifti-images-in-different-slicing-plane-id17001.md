<p>Hello, everyone.</p>
<p>I am trying to load a <strong>DICOM series (series of axial slices)</strong> into Slicer and <strong>export as nifit</strong> in a different slicing plane (<strong>sagittal or corona</strong>l).<br>
Is it possible?</p>
<p>Thanks a lot.</p>

<p>Yes, you can use the Orient Scalar Volume module.</p>
