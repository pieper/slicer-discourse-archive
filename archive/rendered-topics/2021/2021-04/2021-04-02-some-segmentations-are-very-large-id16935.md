<p>So I have created 7 segmentation a from a knee MRI, and 3 of these segmentation seem to be on a different scale because there huge? Even though they were all exported at the same time</p>

<p>Does the large size cause any issues? “Huge” in what sense (large file, large extent, extent of the segmentation does not match image content, etc.)? How did you export the segment? Into what file format?</p>

<p>Have you exported the segmentation using “Export to files” feature? Have you specified a size scale &gt; 1?</p>
