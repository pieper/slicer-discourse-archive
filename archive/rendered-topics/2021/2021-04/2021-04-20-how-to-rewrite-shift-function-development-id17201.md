<p>Hi all<br>
I want to rewrite the shift key function in Python,but I can not find the origin code about the function, could you tell me where to find the code about shift key and mouse move in slicer?</p>

<p>I’m not sure it will be easy to do that in python.  You can study the code for <a href="https://github.com/Slicer/Slicer/search?q=vtkMRMLCrosshairNode"><code>vtkMRMLCrosshairNode</code></a> to see if it can do what you want.</p>
