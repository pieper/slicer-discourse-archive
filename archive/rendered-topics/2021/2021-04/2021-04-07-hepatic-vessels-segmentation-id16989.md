<p>Hi,<br>
You could find useful the following tutorial <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjRURvORR5s&amp;t=546s" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Liver vessels</a>.<br>
There is this helpful <a href="https://lassoan.github.io/SlicerSegmentationRecipes/VesselSegmentationBySubtraction/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Segmentation recipe</a> as well. The task is different from yours, but maybe you can find some inspiration.  It requires the VMTK extension.<br>
I hope it will help you.</p>
