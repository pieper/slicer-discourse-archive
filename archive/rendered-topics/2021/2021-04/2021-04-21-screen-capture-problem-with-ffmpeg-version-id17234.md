<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I want to use screen capture to make a video of fading between my fixed and registered images but before that I get an error while installing FFmpeg. I’m on MacOS Mojave and I installed FFmpeg with : brew install FFmpeg<br>
I tried reinstalling but it says you’re using the most up to date one which is version 4.4</p>
<p>ffmpeg error output: dyld: Library not loaded: /usr/local/opt/zeromq/lib/libzmq.5.dylib<br>
Referenced from: /usr/local/bin/ffmpeg<br>
Reason: Incompatible library version: ffmpeg requires version 8.0.0 or later, but libzmq.5.dylib provides version 5.0.0</p>
<p>Thanks for any help.</p>
