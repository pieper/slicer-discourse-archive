<p>Our sixth publication of our team <em>The Functional Reconstruction of Antikythera Mechanism-The FRAMe Project</em> , which just published in the  <em>Mediterranean Archaeology and Archaeometry</em> Journal .</p>
<p>Our paper entitled " <em>Renumbering of the Antikythera Mechanism Saros Cells, Resulting from the Saros Spiral Mechanical Apokatastasis</em> ",<br>
concerns the recalculation of the numbering of the survived <em>Saros Spiral</em> cells (corrected to <em>Saros Helix</em> according to the ancient Greek naming), which was based on mechanical /structural elements of Symmetry adopted by the ancient manufacturer. The position of these geometric elements is not affected by the strong deformation and displacement of the Mechanism parts, as a result of corrosion and the density of material change.</p>
<p>Based on these data of Symmetry, a correction in the numbering of the Saros cells that have information for the eclipse events, by a factor of “-1” was made from the (until our publication) the accepted Saros cell numbering. Note that this very important correction on the cell numbering was done after 13 years.</p>
