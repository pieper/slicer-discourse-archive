<p>I am having trouble placing curve and surface semilandmarks. For the curve, when I resample the resampled curve is underneath the 3D model instead of constrained to the surface (with the constrain to surface option selected).</p>
<p>For the surface, I am having trouble placing semilandmarks just on the distal articular surface. I am not sure if this is because I do not have a singular landmark data set or because the curves have not been delineated yet</p>
