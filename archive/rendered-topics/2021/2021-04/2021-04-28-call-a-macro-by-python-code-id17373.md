<p>It’s not clear what kind of macro you are referring to.  The script repository has a lot of examples of automating actions.</p>

<p>Hi,<br>
I recorded a macro in 3D slicer using the Qttesting enable mode. I saved it as an xml file. I know how to play it from 3D slicer using the Play Macro button under Edit. But I was wondering if there is any python code or sentence that can be used to play the macro</p>
