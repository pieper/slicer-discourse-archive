<p>I use photogrammetry to make 3D models. I have tried to export the meshes in PLY format, either exporting texture (JPEG file) or exporting the mesh with vertex colors. In other platforms (Meshlab) the colors/texture of the mesh is well imported, but I cannot find a way to import the texture in 3DSlicer.</p>
<p>I have read a previous discussion (<a href="https://discourse.slicer.org/t/displaying-textured-3d-models/2521" class="inline-onebox">Displaying textured 3D models</a>) but I couldn’t find the “Texture model” module of SlicerIGT extension.</p>

<p>Texture model is provided by SlicerIGT extension, both for latest Slicer Stable Release and Slicer Preview Release. Hit <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>F</kbd>, type <code>texture</code>, hit <kbd>Enter</kbd>, and you should see the module.</p>
