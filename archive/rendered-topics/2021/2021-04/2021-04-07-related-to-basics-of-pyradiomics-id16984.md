<p>Hi All,<br>
I am very new to this study … Can anyone guide me how to proceed with learning feature extraction using pyradiomics… and how to understand the documentation better</p>

<p>My suggestion is to start with some of the very good reviews published on how to perform radiomics and what to think about when starting a radiomics study.</p>
<p>Be sure to also check out the Image Biomarker Standardisation Initiative (IBSI).</p>
<p>As to specific questions on how to work with PyRadiomics, my advise would be to tinker a bit with the examples provided in the PyRadiomics git repository, using the interface in Slicer to get a feel for whats happening.</p>
<p>As to specific questions regarding the use of PyRadiomics and regarding some of the settings; There are many posts form users with questions, so first see if your question has already been asked and answered there (either on the slicer discourse or on the PyRadiomics <a href="https://github.com/AIM-Harvard/pyradiomics/issues">issue tracker</a>).</p>
<p>If your question is not listed and you can’t find it in the documentation, start a new topic. On the PyRadiomics issue tracker a template is provided on what we would like to know regarding your issue. This helps you to formulate a concrete question allowing us to reply with a concrete answer.</p>
