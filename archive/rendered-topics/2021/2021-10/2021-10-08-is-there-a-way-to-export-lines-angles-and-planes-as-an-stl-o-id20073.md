<p>I see that segmentations can be exported as STL, but this would not be as clean as having lines and planes. My colleague is hoping to take this information and load it into Solidworks to design a part. Any tips would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>There are many ways to do this, depending on what you want to achieve. What would you like to do with the exported meshes?</p>

<p>Hi Andras, I am hoping to import these lines, planes, and angles into Solidworks to inform the design of an adapter. We need the precise trajectory of one of these lines in reference to an object in the MRI.</p>
