<p>This message does not seem to indicate any problems with loading any valid images, so probably you can ignore the error.</p>
<p>If you need more information then you can share the data set (upload to dropbox, onedrive, etc. and post the link here) or at least share the application log that is collected while the data set is loaded. Make sure no patient information is included.</p>
