<p>Hi everyone!<br>
Is there any way to improve joint smoothing ejecution times? It´s a very time consuming process but it´s the less destructive method for smoothing.<br>
Thanks in advance!!</p>

<p>Joint smoothing has been made much faster (magnitudes faster for certain use cases) in most recent Slicer Preview Releases, compared to the latest Slicer Stable (Slicer-4.11.20210226).</p>
