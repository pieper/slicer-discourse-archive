<p>is there a way to use the export segmentation functionality without opening Slicer,<br>
I have a folder of many segmented .nii file and I am looking for a script that can convert it to .obj file.</p>

<p>Yes, sure that should be no problem at all. You can put your code snippet into a .py file and run it <a href="https://slicer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer_guide/script_repository.html#run-a-python-script-file-in-the-slicer-environment">Slicer’s Python environment</a>.</p>
