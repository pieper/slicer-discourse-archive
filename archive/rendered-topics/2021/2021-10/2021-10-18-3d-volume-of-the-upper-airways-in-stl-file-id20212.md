<p>We created a 3D volume of the upper airways with “grow from seeds”. We wanted to export the volume in stl. When we try to do export the volume, we obtain only the four line of the “paint” and not the entire volume. How can we export the entire volume of the upper airways in STL file?</p>

<p>Probably you missed the last step, which is to click the “Apply” button in the grow from seeds tool.  It’s a common issue, and maybe the interface can be improved so that it’s less likely to happen.  But once you learn it you’ll probably have no problem in the future.</p>
