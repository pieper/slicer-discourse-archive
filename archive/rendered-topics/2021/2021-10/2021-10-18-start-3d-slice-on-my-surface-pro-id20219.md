<p>I have installed 3d surface on the surface pro but it won’t boot. I do not know what the problem might be.</p>

<p>We use Slicer on several Surface Pro tablets without problems. Follow these instructions to resolve application startup issues: <a href="https://slicer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/get_help.html#slicer-application-does-not-start" class="inline-onebox">Get Help — 3D Slicer documentation</a></p>
<p>Whixh Slicer version are you using?</p>
<p>What is the exact model? How much RAM and what graphics does it have?</p>

<p>Microsoft released Surface Pro X too early - before implementing x64 application emulation, so it is incompatible with lots of software, including Slicer.</p>
<p>You either need to wait for Microsoft to add support to run x64 applications (64-bit applications compiled for Intel architecture), or replace your device with an Intel-based Surface Pro.</p>

<p>Hello! I was considering getting one of these for better ergonomics, since I’m performing quite a bit of segmentation these days. Has the compatibility issue been solved? Or is it still better to go for the (albeit now old) Intel version? <a class="mention" href="/u/lassoan">@lassoan</a></p>
