<p>Dear there,<br>
I’m having an issue with connecting the Slicer Debugger with LiClipse.<br>
I’ve already set the debug server port at 5678 and when I press connect from slicer it gives me msg that “the slicer is paused until eclipse accepts the connection!”<br>
I think i miss something from prerequisites of running LiClipse program! Please help!</p>
