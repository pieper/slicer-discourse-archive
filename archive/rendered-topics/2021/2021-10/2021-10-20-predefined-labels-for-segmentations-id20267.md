<p>We want to segment a few hundred 3D CT volumes, all with same labels and colors.<br>
I know how to create label names and colors for one segmentation. How can I reuse it, and also share with others, for labeling all volumes?<br>
Ps.: I tried saving scene to mrml but when I upload it without the original volume it gives error message (Slicer 4.11).</p>
