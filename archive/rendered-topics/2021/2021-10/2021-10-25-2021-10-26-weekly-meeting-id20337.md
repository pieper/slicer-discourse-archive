<p>Hi. I would like to talk about the progress I had developing the new <a href="https://github.com/mauigna06/SlicerSurfaceToolbox/tree/SelectionToolFeature" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">SelectionTool</a> for the dynamic modeler and get some guidance regarding compiling the <a href="https://www.vtkjournal.org/browse/publication/891" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">geodesics library</a> it uses.</p>
<p>Reference: <a href="https://discourse.slicer.org/t/revisiting-rigid-mesh-registration/9424/10" class="inline-onebox">Revisiting Rigid Mesh Registration - #10 by lassoan</a></p>
<p>(Although I’m not sure if a google meets is the best channel to face this problem)</p>
