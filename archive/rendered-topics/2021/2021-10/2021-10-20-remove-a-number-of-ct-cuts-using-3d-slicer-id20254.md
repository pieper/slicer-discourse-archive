Slicer version: 4.10.2<br>
Hi 3D Slicer experts and all<br>
I have some CT images (for example 80 cuts) and I want to delete some of them (for example 16 cuts). How can I do this with 3D Slicer?<br>
Thanks a lot</p>

<p>What do you mean by “deleting some of them”? Would you like to make the spacing between slices variable or just blank out some of the slices (set their values to -1000)?</p>
<p>This is not a commonly needed operation. What is your overall goal?</p>
