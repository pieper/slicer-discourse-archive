<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am quite new to the slicer community. I would like to know how to perform a 3D gamma analysis using python scripting with slicerRT dose comparison tool. Are there any tutorials on this?</p>
<p>Any insights would be much appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Cédric</p>

<p>Hi Cédric,</p>
<p>There are no tutorials on scripting but lots of examples. For example in this <a href="https://github.com/SlicerRt/SlicerRT/blob/master/Testing/Python/IGRTWorkflow_SelfTest.py#L485">Python automated test</a>, a full IGRT workflow is done, including gamma comparison.</p>
