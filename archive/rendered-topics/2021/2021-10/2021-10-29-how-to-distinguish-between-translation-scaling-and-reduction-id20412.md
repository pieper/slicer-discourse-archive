<p>I want to distinguish between translation, enlargement, and reduction by DIR for each contour.<br>
When I asked about this before, I was told that there is a tool called bounding box that can be used to determine scaling, as shown in the image.<br>
Is this to compare the reference image with the transformed image?<br>

When I look at the Slicer, I see that this tool gives values for x, y, and z. How should I interpret these values to determine scaling and translation?<br>
Also, this tool is only for scalar volumes, but is there any way to apply it to DVF?<br>
