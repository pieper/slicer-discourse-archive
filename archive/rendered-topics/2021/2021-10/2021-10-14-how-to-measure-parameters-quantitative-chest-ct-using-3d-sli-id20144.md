<p>Operating system: MacOS BigSur Ver. 11.6<br>
Slicer version: 4.11<br>
Expected behavior: Provide measurement in chest imaging<br>
Actual behavior: It provide some measurement</p>
<p>My name is Yopi Simargi, a radiologist from Jakarta Indonesia. I am planning my COPD research.<br>
I am trying to quantify everything in lung: %LAA-950, %LAA-856, %WA, Mean Lung Density, Air Trapping Index, Percentile 15, Perimetry Internal 10, Area and Density of Pectoralis Muscle, and ratio of pulmonary artery to aorta.</p>
<p>I found it in <a href="https://chestimagingplatform.org/documentation" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Documentation | Chest Imaging Platform (CIP)</a>, it can provide %LAA-950, %LAA-856, %WA, Perimetry Internal 10, Area and Density of Pectoralis Muscle, and ratio of pulmonary artery to aorta. But still do not know for mean lung density, air trapping index and percentile 15. I need help from you guys how to measure it.<br>
Also if there is tutorial video for measurement, it would be great help. Thank you so much.</p>
