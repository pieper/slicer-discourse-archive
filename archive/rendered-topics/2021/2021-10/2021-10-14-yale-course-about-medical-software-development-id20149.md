<p>Our friend and colleague Xenios has put together a great set of material about developing medical software.  The course is free, or $50 if you want a certificate.  There’s a textbook with additional  material.  I read an earlier draft and there’s a lot of very practical information for anyone working in the field.</p>

<p>Hi Steve,</p>
<p>Very interesting program. I will consider it and discuss it with my colleague first. I am still struggling to do the measurement. I hope I can solve this problem.</p>
