<p>Operating system: Windows<br>
Slicer version: 3D Slicer 4.5.0-1<br>
Expected behavior:<br>
Actual behavior:<br>
I didn’t found the MS Lesion Simulator module in my 3D installed slicer. May be this is due to the slicer version. Could any one help me solving this issue please ?<br>
Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>Now, I installed the 3D Slicer 4.13.0- 2021. And I installed the MS Lesion simulator. However, I can’t enter the T1 volume in the input parameters…Only two choices: None and delete current volume as shown in the figure attached.<br>
how to manage this issue please ?<br>

<p>It sounds like you haven’t got any data loaded.  I haven’t used this module but I assume you start by loading a volume.</p>

<p>Thank you Steve for your reply.<br>
I can’t load a T1 volume, It didn’t give me a hand to load the image. As I have told, there is only two choices in front of T1 volume: None and Delete current volume.</p>
