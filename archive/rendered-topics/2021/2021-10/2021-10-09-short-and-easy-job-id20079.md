<p>If a suitable applicant does not contact you for a couple of days then you can ask <a href="https://www.slicer.org/commercial-use.html#commercial-partners">Slicer commercial partners</a>. If the task is done then you can leave a not here that the job is done so that you don’t get more messages about it.</p>
<p>Note that you don’t have to share your email address publicly but you can ask people to contact you by sending a private message by clicking on your username and then on the “mail” button. Let me know in a private message if you want to do this and I can edit your message above and remove your email address from it.</p>
