<p>I have a 31GB .nii file. When I’m tring to import it shows me this message: Error occurred while loading the selected files.<br>
Is there any way I can open it?</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>
Ilias</p>

<p>You have run out of memory. How much RAM do you have?</p>
<p>There are many solutions for this. What kind of image is this, how was it acquired? What would you like to do with the image?</p>
