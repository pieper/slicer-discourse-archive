<p>Hi, I started testing this idea of placing markups by <em>drawing</em>, markups are placed as the pointer moves and resampled. I found it to be easier in some occasions rather than clicking multiple times.</p>

<p>I would be interested in using it for a module I’ve been developing (<a href="https://github.com/netstim/SlicerNetstim/tree/master/WarpDrive" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">WarpDrive</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcBXu5BURVI" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">video</a>), which currently implements something similar to the drawing function in the segment editor, but this fails in the preview version.</p>
<p>Is this something that could be added to Slicer? Perhaps an option in the menu below <em>Place multiple control points</em>.</p>
<p>Brainstorming a bit: could be interesting to have a <em>snapping</em> function based on background grayscale (like photoshop). This could be used in the drawing effect from segment editor.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
