<p>Hello!<br>
I am new to shape analysis in general and I want to correlate a continuous pathological variable ( for example % of necrosis) with shape of a lesion ( I assume spherical topology).</p>
<p>I assume Covariate Significance testing will the module that I use - but I am unsure about how to proceed.<br>
Further I am unsure how to interpret the results that come up in the Population viewer.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance<br>
Adarsh</p>
