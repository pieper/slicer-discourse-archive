<p>i frequently have the paint or eraser forced or stuck on a certain selection that  i didn’t do actually, and wether i cancel and retry or not, it won’t “unstuck till ill let it take effect then undo " command z”</p>
<p>the attached screen shows the stuck effect</p>
<p>it is no big deal but wanted to report that</p>

<p>Do you mean that if you hit Escape (or switch to another effect) while you held down your mouse during painting then next time you activate painting it continues painting (does not remove the aborted paint stroke)?</p>

<p>yes, the only way is to let paint or erase then undo .</p>
<p>abort or cancel won’t do anything</p>

<p>I’ve pushed a fix, it will be available in the Slicer Preview Release from Tuesday. Please test it and let us know if you still find any problems.</p>
