<p>Operating system: Windows 10 19042<br>
Slicer version: 4.11.20200930<br>
Expected behavior: <a href="https://github.com/KitwareMedical/OsteotomyPlanner/wiki/Installation" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Find extension in Extension Manager</a><br>
Actual behavior: Extension Manager does not show Osteotomy Planner extension</p>

<p>I think Dynamic Modeler that comes  by default in recent releases of 3D Slicer pretty much do everything that the osteotomy planner does</p>

<p><a class="mention" href="/u/sam_horvath">@Sam_Horvath</a> is working on reviving the Osteotomy Planner extension, so that it keep high-level features of the planner module but uses Dynamic Modeler module internally. Until this rework is completed (no ETA, as it is a low priority task), Dynamic Modeler module can be used.</p>

<p>Is there a way to implement the Bending of models part with two fiducial points at the moment?</p>
<p>I tried the thinkspline transformation and it is too complex for me for daily use and results are not predictable.</p>
