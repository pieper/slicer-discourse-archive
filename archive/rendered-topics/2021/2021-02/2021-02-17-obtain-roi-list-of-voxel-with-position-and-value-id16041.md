<p>Hello to all,<br>
I’d like to know if it is possible to obtain the list of voxel within a segmentation in osirix and the corrispective value. I’d like to have a list of each value of every voxel in a roi. Is there any implementation using python?</p>
<p>Thank you very much!</p>

<p>What you are asking for should be a small change to this example, just save the coordinates and value rather than the mean.</p>
