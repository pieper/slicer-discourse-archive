<p>Yes, in recent Slicer Preview Releases you can use closed curve markups to measure area and display in views (you can select list of enabled measurements in Measurements section in Markups module).</p>

<p>In latest Slicer Preview Releases, you can enable “area” measurement for markups plane nodes (in Markups module / Measurements section).</p>
