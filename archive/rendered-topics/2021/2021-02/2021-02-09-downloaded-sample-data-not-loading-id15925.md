<p>Operating system: Mac OS Catalina 10.15.2<br>
Slicer version: 4.10.2<br>
Expected behavior: I am trying to download the head and neck SPL atlas which is from the DataStore and then open it for viewing in the 4 view windows.<br>
Actual behavior: I am able to download it, but then once I go to press load nothing appears in any of the windows.</p>

<p>Does it work correctly with latest Stable Slicer Release?</p>
