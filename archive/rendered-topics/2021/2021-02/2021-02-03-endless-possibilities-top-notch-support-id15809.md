<p>We discovered 3D Slicer during our search for a versatile tool for 3D reconstructions of lung CT scans.</p>
<p>3D Slicer proved very helpful for teaching and planning lung surgery as well as during scientific data analysis. The software is complex and powerful, expect a learning curve, but help is always at hand in the vivid Slicer Forum. All interfaces are accessible via Python or C++.</p>
<p>We even managed to create our own 3D Slicer extension<br>

<p>
which provides an easy workflow for segmentation and quantification of infiltrations in lung CTs.</p>
<p>Support during this special project and in the Slicer Support Forum has been exceptional and is certainly amongst the best we have ever experienced when working with open source or commercial software.<br>
Special thanks go to Andras Lasso, Steve Pieper, and James Butler.<br>
They came up with almost immediate responses, provided working example scripts, and even rewrote major parts of the above-mentioned software.</p>
<p>We are looking forward to the future cooperation and the development of 3D Slicer.</p>
