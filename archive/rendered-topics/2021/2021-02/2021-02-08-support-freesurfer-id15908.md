<p>Operating system: Mac Os Catalina<br>
Slicer version: 4.11</p>
<p>Dear experts<br>

<p>Thanks to <a class="mention" href="/u/sunderlandkyl">@Sunderlandkyl</a> and NIH funding to Harvard PNL, FreeSurfer support has greatly improved in Slicer-4.11 and to facilitate easier and more frequent updates, a dedicated <a href="https://github.com/PerkLab/SlicerFreeSurfer">SlicerFreeSurfer</a> extension has been created.</p>
<p>You need to install the SlicerFreeSurfer extension before importing/exporting FreeSurfer data. Try the <a href="https://github.com/PerkLab/SlicerFreeSurfer/wiki/Using-FreeSurfer-Importer">new importer</a>.</p>
