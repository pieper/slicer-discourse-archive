<p>You can position and rotate slice views to be aligned with the joint surface and do distance measurements at selected points (using Markups module / Line tool). Or, you can segment the region between the joint areas and measure the thickness of that surface (search for “thickness” on the forum to find information about how to measure thickness, for example <a href="https://discourse.slicer.org/t/calculate-thickness-of-thin-muscle/13444">here</a>).</p>
