<p>Is anyone else who is using mailing list mode missing emails?</p>
<p>I typically get an email within seconds of the posting.  But sometimes I don’t get a copy of a follow up post.  I haven’t tracked how often, but it’s happening once a day or so lately.</p>

<p>This keeps happening, so I did some research and found that you can look at <a href="https://discourse.slicer.org/admin/email/skipped">https://discourse.slicer.org/admin/email/skipped</a> to see why.</p>
<p>It turns out there are a bunch listed as: “Maximum number of emails for your plan has been reached”.</p>
<p>I don’t think there’s any other notification of this limit.</p>
<p>It’s also not clear how much it will cost to increase this limit.  Does anyone <span class="mention">@here</span> know or know how to find out?</p>
<p>I would like to know I can rely on getting the emails or I will probably give up on mailing list mode entirely.</p>

<p>We should try to ask for a limit raise. The discussions here are serious and valuable, I would think that discourse would be OK with sponsoring a bit more emails.</p>

<p>I agree - let’s follow up on the email thread (real email) so nobody misses communication on this topic.</p>
