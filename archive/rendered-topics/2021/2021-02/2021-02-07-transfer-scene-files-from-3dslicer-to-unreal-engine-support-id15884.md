<p>Hello,<br>
I am trying to transfer 3DSlicer image to Magic leap. There doenst seem to be a direct a way to do this (as of I know).</p>
<p>One option to explore is to transfer 3DSlicer to Unreal Engine and later import that to Magic Leap.</p>
<p>Has anyone transferred images from 3DSlicer to Unreal Engine? Is this a supported feature?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

    Is it possible to create a model of a body with all the underlying organs, etc and then import the model into Unreal game engine for further interaction between user and the simulation? And how would the importation be done? This is meant to be done in Virtual Reality, so ideally the user will wear the headset, see a body and be able to interact with it, and the interactions and consequences are programmed in Unreal. I know there’s an extension SlicerVR, but do not think it’s sophisticated enoug…

<p>Most efforts so far have been focused on bridging Slicer with <em>Unity</em> engine (see for example <a href="https://discourse.slicer.org/t/collaborative-planning-in-virtual-reality/14841/10">here</a>). Probably the reason is that in medical imaging applications game engines are mostly used for quick early prototyping in small projects, usually by students and hobbyist programmers; and for them Unity is much more palatable than Unreal.</p>
