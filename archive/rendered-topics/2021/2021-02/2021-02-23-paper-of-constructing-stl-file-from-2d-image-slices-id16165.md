<p>Can I find some paper of 3d Slicer about Method of reconstruction from 2d image? or any information about 3d Slicer that makes the model STL file.<br>
Thank you.</p>

<p>See details on the algorithms <a href="https://discourse.slicer.org/t/geometry-extraction/16113/2">here</a>. Maybe we gave specific references to papers in other posts, but except flying edges, these are very well known classic methods.</p>
