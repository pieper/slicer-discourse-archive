<p>Maybe we need another category for “new data” or maybe “general interest” for posts like Paulo’s.  People may want to post about new data or ML tools or other topics not strictly related to Slicer but, like Paulo’s, likely to be of interest to the Slicer community.  Perhaps a “medical image computing” community section?</p>

    Hi all, 
I apologize if I’m posting in the wrong section (if so please remove/move this post). 
We just released a free (non commercial use) dataset made of 62 submillimetric CT scans of COVID-19 positive patients. 
Automatic lung tissue labeling and human-based clinical score are provided as well. 
Maybe in this difficult historical period, this dataset can be useful for your research. 
Here the article: 

My 2 cents.
