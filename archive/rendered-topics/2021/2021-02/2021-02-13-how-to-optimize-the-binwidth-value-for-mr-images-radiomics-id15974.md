<p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>I’m trying to extract the radiomic features from MR images using Pyradiomics extension on 3DSlicer.</p>
<p>I know that the default setting for the binwidth is 25. However, I am not sure which value is more suitable for my studies. How can I optimize this value? Some features cannot be calculated when I use the default value.</p>
<p>Thank you for your help.</p>
