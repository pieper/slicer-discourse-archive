<p>It may be a stupid question, but for some reason after loading a new cbct scan Dicom files, I click crop volume then choose the area that I would like to crop then click apply, nothing happened… usually it used to work however right now nothing happened.</p>
<p>Using mac os tried 4.10 and 4.11 and still cropping is not working</p>

<p>Are there any error messages in the application log (menu: Help / Report a bug)?</p>
<p>Maybe it helps if you go to menu: Edit / Application settings / Modules and check “Prefer executable CLIs” option.</p>
