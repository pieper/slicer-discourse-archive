<p>Dear community,</p>
<p>is the GrowCut segmentation module still available? I can not find it in the extensions nor in the basic version of 3D slicer.</p>
<p>Thank you very much,<br>
Siegmund Lang</p>

<p>Yes! An optimized version of the original GrowCut segmentation implementation (about 10x faster, with interactive updates during editing, with additional option of masking and specifying locality constraint) is available in Segment Editor module. The effect is called “Grow from seeds”.</p>
