<p>i wish there is a way I can toggle between segments selection instead of choosing from menu.</p>
<p>i go back and from making segments and i wish i can do that faster</p>
<p>thank you</p>

<p>There are several shortcuts to switch segments and effects - see <a href="https://slicer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/modules/segmenteditor.html#keyboard-shortcuts">documentation</a>.</p>
