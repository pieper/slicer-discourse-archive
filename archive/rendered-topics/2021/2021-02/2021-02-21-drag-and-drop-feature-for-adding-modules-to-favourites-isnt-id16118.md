<p>I am using the latest version of 3D slicer (4.11.20200930) on a MacOs. The ‘drag and drop’ feature for adding modules to ‘favourites’ isn’t working. I tried looking for any possible changes in settings and also went through the documentation, but couldn’t figure out a solution. Is there any way to fix this?</p>
<p>Operating system: MacOs Catalina (10.15.7)<br>
Slicer version: 4.11.20200930</p>

<p>I suggest you go to “Application settings” in the “File” menu, choose “Modules”, here you can drag and drop the modules to your “favorite modules”!</p>

<p>Hey! Thanks for taking the time to try and help me. I apologise for not being clear enough about the issue in my post. The thing is, probably due to some glitch I am unable to perform the whole drag and drop thing with the modules for adding them to favourites. When I click on a module and try dragging it to the favourite section, its icon doesn’t move at all. It’s like the whole ‘drag and drop’ feature is disabled.</p>

<p>I’ve tried this on a mac and it works well for me. Can you attach a screen capture video of how you are trying to drag-and-drop the modules?</p>

<p>I observe the same behavior on macos 12.3.1 (Apple Silicon through Rosetta) with Slicer 4.11.20210226 r29738 / 7a593c8 – drag and drop is not working. I’ve tried with an external mouse and trackpad, FWIW. Possibly Rosetta related?</p>
<p>A screen capture is not really helpful, you just see the mouse cursor moving.</p>

<p>Please provide a screen capture. I would need to see where exactly you move your mouse cursor. If possible, use a screen recorder that indicates when you click/release a mouse button.</p>
