<p>Using 4.13.0-2021-01-31 r29669 / 8a3730d on Arch Linux self-built.</p>
<p>The Data Probe collapsible pane disappears every time I switch to Volume Rendering <em>from</em> DICOM module.</p>
<p>It can be put back with code from <a href="https://discourse.slicer.org/t/simple-way-to-disable-data-probe-for-some-modules/10544/2">here</a>.</p>
<p>Restore of a permanent Data Probe collapsible pane would be welcome.</p>
<p>Regards.</p>

<p>Thanks for reporting, this is a regression introduced a few weeks ago. It’ll be fixed in the Slicer Preview Release tomorrow.</p>
