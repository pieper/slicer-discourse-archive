<p>I have a 3D model with regions of interest (ROIs) identified with different vertex/face colors. I can see the colored model in Slicer by enabling “Visible” in the Scalars section in Models module. Screenshot bellow for reference.</p>

<p>Is there any way I can convert the model to segmentation node, creating separate segmentations for each color? I have tried to load the ROIs as different models and creating the segmentation for each, however, the resulting segmentations were not accurate.</p>
<p>I would appreciate any help you can give me. Thanks in advance!</p>
