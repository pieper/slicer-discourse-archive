<p>Operating system: windows 10<br>
Slicer version: 4.11<br>
Expected behavior: to create excel file including distance between more than two markups<br>
Actual behavior: there is no option for that</p>

<p>I don’t think there’s an option for that right now, but you might look at <a href="https://github.com/SlicerMorph/SlicerMorph/tree/master/Docs/MergeMarkups">the MergeMarkups module</a> to see if it can do what you need.  Otherwise it would be a very simple script to write.</p>

<p>You can also simply copy-paste markups to/from Excel sheets directly. You don’t even need to write to file.</p>
