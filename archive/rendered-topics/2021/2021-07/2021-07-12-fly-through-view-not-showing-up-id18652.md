<p>Dear Experts,<br>
I’m facing a problem with the Fly through in Endoscopy. Here’s what I did:</p>
<ol>
<li>I loaded all the slices and use volume rendering to create a clean volume.</li>
<li>I created several fiducial points in Markups (I dragged all the points into the first fiducial I created).</li>
<li>I entered Endoscopy, selected the default camera, and the fiducials I created as input. Then I clicked create path.<br>
However, nothing happened when I clicked create path. The Flythrough section beneath the Path section was always grey and I couldn’t do anything on that. I’m sure I missed or messed up with some steps. But I couldn’t find any tutorial on this. Could anyone point any direction for me please?<br>
Thank you very much!</li>
</ol>

<p>I’ve tried the latest Slicer Preview Release and it worked well. Let us know if you have any problem with using the module in the latest Slicer Preview Release.</p>

<p>Thanks for such prompt reply. It worked in the preview release. I guess I messed something up with the fiducial. I’ll go back to the version I used too. Thank you very much! It’s been a excellent software and a great community.</p>
