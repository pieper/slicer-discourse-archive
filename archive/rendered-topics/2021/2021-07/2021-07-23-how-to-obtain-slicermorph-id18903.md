<p>Please follow the instructions at <a href="https://github.com/SlicerMorph/SlicerMorph#installation" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">the official repository</a>.</p>
<p>We advise using the latest stable version of 3D Slicer with SlicerMorph, as updating SlicerMorph is much simpler that way. If you opt to use a preview release, remember that you will need to download and install a newer release to get the updates.</p>

<p>Currently, SlicerMorph is not searchable through the extension manager in either the preview build (4.13.0) or 4.10.1.</p>

<p>SlicerMorph is not available for 4.10 series. Try either the latest stable or the preview (I saw it should be available for todays build, as I downloaded earlier today).</p>

<p>I have both the 4.10.0 installation, and the preview build of 4.13.0. The 4.13.0 is not showing SlicerMorph or SlicerRadiomics as downloadable modules.</p>

<p>As I said, SlicerMorph is not available for 4.10 versions.</p>
<p>As for your issue with 4.13, occasionally extension builds fail for the specific preview version either due to a bug that crept in during an update or due to a problem with build system. You might have downloaded 4.13 version that suffers from such an issue. These are usually  fixed in the next daily build or so. So, try with a newer preview build. I know that SlicerMorph is available at least for the 4.13 in the last 3-4 days…</p>
