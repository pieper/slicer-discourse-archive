<p>I haven’t looked in a while, but I believe there’s a lot in VMTK lab that is not in the Slicer VMTK extension,  So you need to use the two independently and share data via files.  Now that the VMTK extension builds are working again it would be great if someone took a fresh look at closer integration.</p>

<p>i hope that the CFD module in vmtklab can be integrated into the next version of VMTK.</p>

<p>VMTKLab is a commercial product built on top of VMTK. The user interface could be probably reproduced in Slicer quite easily, but there may be some additional processing steps in VMTKLab that are not in VMTK.</p>

<p>You need to reach Luca Antigua to get definitive answer on the status of VMTKLab. You can keep writing to him, maybe once a week, and I’m sure he’ll get back to you after a while.</p>
