<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I set SetSliceToRASByNTP to set a different view for a specific purpose.<br>
My question is: Is there any way to go back to the “by default” view after setting a different one?<br>
Does SetOrientationToDefault() would work?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Yes, <code>SetOrientationToDefault</code> should reset the slice view to its default orientation.</p>
