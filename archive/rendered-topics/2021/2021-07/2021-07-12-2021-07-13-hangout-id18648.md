<p>Some topics I started:</p>
<ul>
<li>I had the problem that compilation was slow even with unchanged files. I was compiling with the command line, using visual studio made the compilation faster.</li>
<li>I talked about how the transforms on BoneReconstructionPlanner could be defined on two ways. I’ll show this in more detail on the next meeting</li>
</ul>
