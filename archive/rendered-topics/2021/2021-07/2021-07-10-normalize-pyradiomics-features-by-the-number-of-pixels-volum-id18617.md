<p>Hey guys,<br>
I am extracting radiomics from several different volume ROIS. I am afraid the ROI volume affects my evaluation, since many radiomic features are not divided by the number of pixels. I did even read an article speaking about the bias caused by volume yet present in many features.<br>
I believe a reasonable solution would be to divide those non-volume-normalized features by the number of pixels.</p>
<p>What do you guys think?</p>
