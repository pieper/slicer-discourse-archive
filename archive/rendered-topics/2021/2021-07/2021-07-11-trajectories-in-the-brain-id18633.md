<p>I’m working on projectile wound trajectory tracking in the brain using DICOM CT in Slicer. I wonder if there is a module / that allows 3D Slicer tracking to establish possible projectile routes</p>

<p>That sounds interesting and doable, but I don’t think anyone has done work in that area exactly.  There has been some <a href="https://www.slicer.org/w/img_auth.php/d/de/TBISegmentation_tutorial.pdf">TBI research</a> and an <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3353935/">interesting analysis of Phineas Gage</a>.</p>
