<p>VTK’s build system has been completely replaced in VTK9. Fortunately, we managed to get funding for updating VMTK’s build infrastructure for VTK9 and the work has just been completed last week. We are testing this in Slicer now and if everything goes well then <a href="https://github.com/vmtk/vmtk/pull/372">this pull request</a> will be merged soon.</p>

<p>It is already available via conda. New release on PyPI is still a work in progress. You can also get VMTK in 3D Slicer application’s virtual Python environment (Python-3.9.10).</p>

<p>If you need specifically vtk 9.0.3, let me know here or on the conda github (<a href="https://github.com/conda-forge/vmtk-feedstock" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">GitHub - conda-forge/vmtk-feedstock: A conda-smithy repository for vmtk.</a>) and I can add it. The vmtk on conda is currently set to vtk 9.1 due to issues with 9.0.3 that have since been fixed.</p>
