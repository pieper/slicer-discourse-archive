<p>I am trying to change slicer splash screen and loading screen. When I replaced the splash image with another image it worked. But the loading screen image is not changing. I replaced the watermark image too. That didn’t help.</p>

    I’ve fiddled around with editing the filepath in SlicerApp.arc as well as slicerlaunchersettings.ini to no avail. Could someone please help me? I have a custom .png file I’d like to change to.
