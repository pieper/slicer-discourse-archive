<p>Hello,<br>
I was able to connect Polaris vicra with 3d slicer to track the position of the tip of a probe.<br>
Now my goal is to send the position of this tip through ROS.<br>
I have 3D slicer running on windows and I would like to know if I can send the information of the position of the tip to a virtual machine running ubuntu.</p>
<p>Hope anybody can help!</p>

<p>Yes, you can send&amp;receive positions between Slicer and ROS.</p>
<p>There was a project about this at the Project Week, it may contain useful information: <a href="https://projectweek.na-mic.org/PW35_2021_Virtual/Projects/ROSMED/" class="inline-onebox">NA-MIC Project Weeks | Website for NA-MIC Project Weeks</a></p>
<p>If you run into any specific issues then let us know.</p>
