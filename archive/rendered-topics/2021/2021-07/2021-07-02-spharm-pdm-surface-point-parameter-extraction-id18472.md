<p>After running group-level statistical models on the SPHARM surfaces, and generating 3D illustrations of areas that are significantly related to our independent variable of interest, I am curious whether it is possible to go back and extract the individual-level parameters within these regions of significance to allow for plotting or other post-hoc assessments?</p>
<p>For example, in our case we have identified shape changes that are significantly correlated with a metric of disease severity in our sample. Our colleagues - and I would imagine likely future reviewers - have asked to see a scatterplot of the data within these regions to aid with interpretation of the effect.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>
<p>Best,<br>
Ian</p>
