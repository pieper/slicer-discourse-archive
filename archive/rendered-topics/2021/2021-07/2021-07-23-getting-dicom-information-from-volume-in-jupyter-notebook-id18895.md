<p>I have loaded a volume into Jupyter Notebook from Python and I am looking to find the birthday of the patient in that volume. Is there a simple way to do this? I have looked at ways regarding the volume’s DICOM data, but have been unable to find a good answer. Thanks!</p>

<p>See examples for getting any DICOM metadata using Python scripting in the <a href="https://slicer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer_guide/script_repository.html#access-top-level-tags-of-dicom-images-imported-into-slicer">script repository</a>.</p>
