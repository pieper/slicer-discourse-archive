<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>I am trying to segment the individual cranial bones of human skulls, approximately 350 or so. I’m currently using volume rendering to show the 3D skull and then using threshold masking to apply the paint effect to each individual bone. 1) this is incredibly taxing of CPU and 2) is a bit fiddly and time consuming. Is there a more efficient way that I am missing?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for any suggestions!</p>
<p>Jamie</p>

<p>What is the end goal of the segmentation (what is the clinical application)?<br>
How many bone pieces do you need to segment for each skull?<br>
Can you show a few example segmentations?<br>
What is the resolution of your images?</p>
