<p>I know you can run Slicer on a Surface Tablet and a <a href="https://discourse.slicer.org/t/3d-slicer-on-a-surface-studio/7536">Surface Studio</a>, but has anyone tried on a <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/business/surface-hub-2" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Surface Hub 2S</a>?</p>

<p>It should work without any problems - the same way as on any Windows 10 PC with a large display. You can probably navigate the views (rotate, zoom, pan, twist) using multi-touch and use the pen for precise drawing.</p>

<p>Our hospital network just got a few of these and apparently they installed <strong>Windows 10 Team</strong>, which is a simplified version of <strong>Windows 10</strong>. Thankfully, there are ways of <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/surface-hub/surface-hub-2s-migrate-os" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">migrating the device</a> to the full version of Windows 10 Pro. Otherwise, I may try using a portable version of Slicer!</p>
