<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>Hopefully someone can help me fix the issue I have been having. I recently updated the GPU in my computer from a 1070 to an RTX 3070 Ti. All drivers are up to date, running the most updated version of windows on an I7-10700k. For some reason I am unable to get Slicer to open properly. I get a white screen when opening the application and it fails to load. I have tried reinstalling, and even installing older versions and even the preview release to no luck. I have tried version 4.11 and 4.10 and every time I launch the program does not respond. Any advice to fix this?</p>
