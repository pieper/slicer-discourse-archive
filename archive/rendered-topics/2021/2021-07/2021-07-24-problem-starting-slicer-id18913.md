<p>Hi Community, I’m getting into the software. I have a problem with the software when starting, the window is blank, I tried downloading the 2 versions for windows, the Stable Release version and the Preview Release version. In both the same thing happens, I use Win10. Maybe someone else has happened to me, or knows why this happens. Thank you very much indeed. Best regards!!</p>

<p>Most likely your computer uses a chipset that is too old to run Slicer (see more information <a href="https://slicer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/getting_started.html#recommended-hardware-configuration">here</a>). What is your CPU model and graphics card?</p>

<p>Hi, I downloaded the first version and it is actually working! Thanks!</p>
<p>I have a Notebook Dell xps L502X<br>
Intel(R) Core™ i7-2630QM CPU @ 2.00GHz   2.00 GHz<br>
Intel HM67 Express Chipset Family LPC Interface Controller - 1C4B.<br>
8,00 GB Ram<br>
NVIDIA GeForce GT540M</p>
<p>If you have any other information or alternative to use the most recent version will be more than welcome, in the meantime I will start with an older version. Best regards</p>

<p>i7-2630QM chipset was released 10 years ago. Current Slicer versions are not compatible with such hardware. We aim for keeping Slicer compatible with hardware released in the last 5 years - the reasons are described <a href="https://slicer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/getting_started.html#recommended-hardware-configuration">here</a>.</p>
