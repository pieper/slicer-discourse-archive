<p>Hi team of 3D slicer,</p>
<p>Kindly, I would like to know if there is any extension in the 3D slicer which could be used for measuring the average density (i.e., HU) of lung consolidation in non-contract CT Lung ?</p>

<p>You can use <a href="https://github.com/rbumm/SlicerLungCTAnalyzer">LungCTAnalyzer</a>, Chest Imaging Platform, MONAILabel extensions to segment lung and consolidations automatically, potentially combined with semi-automatic and manual tools in Segment Editor module.</p>
