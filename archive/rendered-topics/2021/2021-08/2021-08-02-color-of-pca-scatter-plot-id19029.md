<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I’ve made a PCA scatter plot in the SlicerMorph package. The points are this really light blue color and I was wondering if there was any way to change the color of the points?</p>

<p>You should use the Plots module to change anything related to the aesthetics of the plots (colors, labels, size, fonts etc)…</p>
<p>Hit CTRL+F and search for Plots. And then choose the plot you want to modify.</p>
<p>Next time please tag your question with SlicerMorph (under categories look for Community-SlicerMorph). It will be easier for us to see that this is related to SlicerMorph specific question.</p>
