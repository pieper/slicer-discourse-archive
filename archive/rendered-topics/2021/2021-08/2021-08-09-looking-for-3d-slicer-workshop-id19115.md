<p>Hi there, I wonder is there any 3D slicer workshop that I can attend to improve my knowledge and skills in this software? Thank you.</p>

<p>We do a week-long short course that’s a combination of intro to 3D Slicer and morphometrics shape analysis (via SlicerMorph). There will be an online version sometime in the next 3-4 months. You can sign up at <a href="http://bit.ly/SM-listserv" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Slicermorph-announcements Info Page</a> to get notified when it is open for enrollment.</p>
<p>We have some self-paces tutorials that you can give it a try. They are more focused on SlicerMorph functionalities, but if this section on some of the commonly used Slicer core modules might be useful for you <a href="https://github.com/SlicerMorph/Tutorials/#additional-tutorials-for-some-slicer-modules-used-commonly-for-digital-morphology-tasks" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">GitHub - SlicerMorph/Tutorials: SlicerMorph module tutorials</a></p>

<p>There is also another <a href="https://projectweek.na-mic.org/">Project Week</a> planned for January 2022.  The hope is to have it in person, but it’s very likely to be a virtual event again.  But that’s okay if it allows more people to participate, as happened in the most recent one.</p>

<p>What a great community we have. I really appreciate  on the feedbacks and looking forwards to learn more. I am student and currently using this software on my dissertation. I hope that I could use this software in my work later. Thank you.</p>
