<p>You did not report any issue. Please include the description of the problem.</p>
<p>Plus you are using a very old version of Slicer. Whatever you are trying to do, try with the latest stable (<a href="https://download.slicer.org" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://download.slicer.org</a>), and then if the issue persists, report back.</p>
