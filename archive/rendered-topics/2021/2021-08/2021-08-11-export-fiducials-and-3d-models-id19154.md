<p>Hi community</p>
<p>I’me new to using 3D slicer.</p>
<p>I can successfully export my 3D model onto STL files well.<br>
I’ve just put 5 fiducial markers on it using the mark up tool.</p>
<p>I want export the 3d model with the points on.<br>
Anyone knows how to do this?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Markups and models are different data representations. I you need to share your model with fiducials on with someone, you can simply package the whole scene as MRB and send it to your collaborator (see <a href="https://slicer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/data_loading_and_saving.html" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Data Loading and Saving — 3D Slicer documentation</a>)</p>
