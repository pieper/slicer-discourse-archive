<p>Having problem with mesh statistics extension. Unable to install it.</p>
<p>Searching in the model list it appears that the “module is not loaded”.</p>
<p>I’m using Slicer version 4.13</p>
<p>Thanks for all of you that can give me some help.</p>

<p>Please try the very latest Slicer Preview Release and if you still have problems with it then upload the application log somewhere and post the link here.</p>
