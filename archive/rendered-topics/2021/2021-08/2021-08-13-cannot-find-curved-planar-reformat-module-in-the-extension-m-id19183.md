<p>Hi Everyone, I am here again.<br>
I am trying to add a centerline into my animal heart model in 3D Slicer (Win. 4.11.20210226) as the tutorial <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yi07mjr3JeU&amp;t=146s" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">New vessel branch extraction module for 3D Slicer - YouTube</a>. But I cannot find the “Curved Planar reformat Module” in the Extension Manager. Does anyone know how to make it?<br>
Thanks in advance and have a lovely weekend.</p>
