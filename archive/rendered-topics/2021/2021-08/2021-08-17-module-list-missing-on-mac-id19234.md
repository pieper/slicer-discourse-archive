<p>Operating system: Mac OS 10.14<br>
Slicer version: 4.13 and 4.11<br>
Expected behavior: start<br>
Actual behavior: does not find module list</p>
<p>Hi there, I am trying to get 3D Slicer run on a Mac (10.14). The program does start and open but in the module list it stays on “search”. Even after the week-end it did not change. Everything I could find was for PC or Linux, but not Mac. Any idea?</p>
<p>Downloading new did not help.</p>
<p>Thanx!!!</p>

<p>Thanks for reporting this. Could you attach a screenshot so that we can see what is happening exactly?</p>

<p>I just figured out that I need to activate the “show hidden modules” in the application settings…</p>
