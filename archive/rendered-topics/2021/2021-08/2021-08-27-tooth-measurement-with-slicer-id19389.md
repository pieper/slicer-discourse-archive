<p>Hi everyone,<br>
I am a dentist by profession and an orthodontist in making. I am doing a project where we are aiming to measure linear and angular tooth movement in all three planes of space by superimposing 3d scans of pre and post orthodontic(braces) treatment. I need some help with superimposition and then make the measurements. Can anybody please guide or help me with that?<br>
Looking forward to your response.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Kind Regards,<br>
Furqan Jamal</p>

<p>Hi Furqan</p>
<p>I’m an ENT surgeon and a Slicer user for 2+ years and I would recommend to try the landmark registration first so you can have a sense how it can be done.<br>
Then, I would try the elastix module to test the registration on your dataset.<br>
The measurements may be done using the measurements tools from Slicer.<br>
Hope it helps</p>
