<p>Hi,<br>
I want to use the mean Hausdorff Distance as a validaton metric to compare ground truth with predicted segmentation masks. What is the theoretical background that 3D slices use to calculate AHD?</p>
<p>Thank you in advance,<br>

<p>There are a number of extensions that compute Hausdorff distance. Their implementation may be slightly different. Which extension and module do you use?</p>

<p>I use module Segment Comparison and results from Hausdorff distance metrics.</p>
