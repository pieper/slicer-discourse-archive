Hello good morning, I would like to know how to be able to segment in 3D by selecting a plane, that is, I need to select 2 points to segment. And I would also like to know if from a segmented image, it is possible to divide it into segments, thirds … thanks</p>

<p>These all sound doable. <a href="https://slicer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/image_segmentation.html">This</a> is a good page to get started. You can also find lots of segmentation tutorials on youtube.</p>
<p>What do you need to segment on what kind of images?</p>

<p>Thanks for your information. I want to segment the root of a tooth from two specific points previously selected; and then divide this root into three-thirds of equal size. Thanks!!</p>
