<p>Hello, I would like to make one of my segments completely opaque and the other not. Is this possible? I have tried doing this in the segmentations module but it always changes both at the same time.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

<p>In the segmentations module, you can change the opacity of any segment. Look under “Opacity” in the list of segments.</p>
