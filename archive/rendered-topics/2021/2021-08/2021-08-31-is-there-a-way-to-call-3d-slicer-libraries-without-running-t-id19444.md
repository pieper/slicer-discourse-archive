<p>Operating system: Windows 10<br>
Slicer version: 4.11.20210226</p>
<p>I want to use 3D splicer libraries for a full-body mesh. Nothing more, and not complex. I want to call the 3Dsplicer libraries without opening the program. It could be through a command-line interface. Is there a specific call line?</p>
