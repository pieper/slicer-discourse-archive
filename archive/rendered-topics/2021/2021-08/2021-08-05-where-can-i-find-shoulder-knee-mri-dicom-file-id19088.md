<p>Hi</p>
<p>I need shoulder and knee MRI files for a research. Any ideas on where I can find it?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>In general, I would recommend to ask images from your clinical collaborators. They can provide not just images but also help interpreting them and ensure you are developing clinically useful solutions.</p>
<p>If you just want to find some random images then you can browse large image databases, such as <a href="https://www.cancerimagingarchive.net/">TCIA</a>. Since it is a database for cancer cases, you won’t find a lot of knee and shoulder MRIs, but there should be some.</p>
<p>You can also check out the <a href="https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/visible/visible_human.html">visible human project data sets</a>. The image acquisition protocols are quite old and do not reflect current musculoskeletal imaging protocols used for shoulder/knee MRI nowadays, but may be OK for quick initial tests.</p>
