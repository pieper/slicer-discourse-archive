<p>I want to erase a certain segment in my segmentations using erase in the segment editor. But I also want the erase to remove the surrounding segments if it is in the area of what I want to remove. Sort of like the “Apply to all segments in erase”. Right now I see that erase has “erase all segments” but when I click that nothing happens. Is there a way to do this?</p>

<p>This was a regression that has been <a href="https://github.com/Slicer/Slicer/issues/5584">fixed</a> in recent Slicer Preview Releases.</p>

<p>I’m using 4.13.0-2021-08-24 but still seem to be having the same issue.</p>
