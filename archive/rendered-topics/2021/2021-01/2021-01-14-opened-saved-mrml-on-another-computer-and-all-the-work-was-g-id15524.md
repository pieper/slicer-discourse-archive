<p>Operating system: macOS Mojave<br>
Slicer version: 4.11.20200930<br>
Expected behavior:<br>
Actual behavior: I posted about having trouble with macOS Big Sur. I downloaded this version of Slicer onto a computer running Mojave. When I opened up saved Scenes to Slicer on this mac, it was as if I had done no work on the project and it was being opened for the first time. No colored segments were revealed. It was like no work had been completed. Suggestions?</p>
