<p>Thanks for the opportunity to become a commercial partner.</p>
<p>My research team is made up of medical students/residents/physicians with background in computer science, so we have more extensive knowledge on the human body and the goals of medical projects compared to engineers. Also, we don’t charge high costs for services, as our research team contributes to projects mainly for our own learning and our CV. We are introduced to projects as volunteers.</p>
