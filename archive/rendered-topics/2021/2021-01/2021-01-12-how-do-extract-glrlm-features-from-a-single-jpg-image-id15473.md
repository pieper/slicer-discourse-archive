<p>Operating system: Windows<br>
Slicer version:<br>
Expected behavior:<br>
Actual behavior:<br>
I am a learner and want to generate Gray Level Run Length Matrix features for a .jpg image. I am reading an image via opencv but could not understand about ‘mask’ input. Thus, can anybody help me by providing any sample code in python which can extract features using PyRadiomics.</p>

<p>The PyRadiomics repository on github contains several example scripts detailing the usage of PyRadiomics. Additionally, you can find many details in the extensive online documentation at <a href="http://pyradiomics.readthedocs.io">pyradiomics.readthedocs.io</a></p>
