<p>I need to install vmtk(to use vmtkcenterlinesmoothing, etc)in 3d slicer through the python interactor. How do I do that, I am on a windows terminal, any help is appreciated.<br>
I know I can install scipy and others using slicer.utils.pip_install(), but that does not work for vmtk. Can I use conda? please let me, thanks.<br>
Operating system: windows 10<br>
Slicer version:4.11</p>
