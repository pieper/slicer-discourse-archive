<p>Hello,<br>
I want to create DRR image from CT scan.<br>
I found <a href="https://github.com/lancelevine/SlicerDRRGenerator" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">SlicerDRRGenerator</a>, but I don’t know how to install it to Slicer…<br>
I used the Extension Wizard. The extension is not fully installed. The GUI differs from the one in the published paper by the developer.<br>
If the extension is not working, is there any method to create DRR?<br>
Thanks.</p>
