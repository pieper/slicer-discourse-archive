<p>Hello all,</p>
<p>I need to separate gray and white matter and CSF from a volume, but I cannot find the BrainTissuesExtension. I am new here so I don’t know if there is an efficient way to segment it, or how can I install it.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Hi! Brain tissue segmentation is something I’ve worked on quite a bit.</p>
<p>The BrainTissuesExtension can be hit or miss depending on your Slicer version, a lot of people run into that wall. There are a couple of other approaches that tend to give cleaner results anyway, but the right one really depends on your data and what you need the segmentation for.</p>
<p>Is this MRI or CT? And are you looking for a rough separation or something publication/analysis ready?</p>
