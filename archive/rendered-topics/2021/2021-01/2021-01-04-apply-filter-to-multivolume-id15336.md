<p>Hello all! I’m relatively new to 3D Slicer. I am currently using the T2 mapping module on knee scans, but I am wondering if I can apply a filter (specifically the gradient anisotropic diffusion image filter from ITK) to the multivolume data before performing the T2 mapping. I’ve been able to apply filters on 3D volumes, but I have yet to figure out if I can do the same on multivolumes.</p>
<p>I’m currently using version 4.10.2 on Windows 10.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!<br>
Nate</p>
