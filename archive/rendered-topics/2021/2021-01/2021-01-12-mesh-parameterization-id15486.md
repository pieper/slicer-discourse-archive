<p>Hi,</p>
<p>When parameterizing a mesh as in the Mapping and Patching tutorial, how is the orientation of the circumferential axis chosen?</p>
<p>I would like to compare parameterized meshes of various vessels and would like it such that the circumferential coordinates were at similar landmarks.</p>
<p>Thank you,<br>
Shion</p>
