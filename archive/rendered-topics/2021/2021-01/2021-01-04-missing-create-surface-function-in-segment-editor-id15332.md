<p>Hi,<br>
When I open segment editor , I don’t see a create surface tool in the window. How can I get this option, which extension to be downloaded.<br>
Thank you.<br>

<p>That function is available as “Show 3D”.</p>

<p>You mean show 3D and create surface . Are they same?</p>

<p>Yes, they are exactly the same. “Create surface” was the old name that we used a several years ago. Where did you still find reference to it?</p>

<p>Hey everyone,</p>
<p>There is no Create surface option under my Show 3D button in the Segment Editor module. I have previously uploaded my DICOM data, created a segment, used the threshold and island tool to isolate the bone I am interested in. I can see that there is almost nothing left outside of my bone in the 3 3D views but there is still no create surface tool option available under “Show 3D” (only surface smoothing and smoothing factor).</p>
<p>Is there any step I have missed so far that could explain this lack of option?</p>
<p>Thank you so much for your help and have a nice day!</p>

<p>To see the segment in 3D, push the “Show 3D” button. Not the small drop-down menu arrow on the button’s right side, but the middle of the button.</p>
