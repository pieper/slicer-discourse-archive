<p>How do I harden transformation for 100 segmentations…</p>
<p>Normally I have to right click them all and click harden transformation for each segmentation.</p>
<p>Is there any way to do it at once?</p>

<p>In Data module, you can create a folder, select all items, drag them in the folder, and apply&amp;harden the transform to that folder.</p>
