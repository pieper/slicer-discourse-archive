<p>I’m currently using screen capture to export the image sequence as png with markup visualized. The only problem I’m finding is that it exactly captures the dimensions of the screen instead of the volume (I know this is the goal of a screen recorder). I’m wondering if it is possible to set the dimension to exactly match the dicom volume? I Couldn’t find a way in the scene view to make this match precisely (I don’t trust doing this manually by eye).</p>

<p>In general, you should not rely on consumer file formats and burnt-in annotations.</p>
<p>What is the overall goal of your project and what would you like to achieve with exporting burnt-in annotations?</p>
