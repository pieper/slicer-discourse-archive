<p>Operating system: Mac<br>
Slicer version: 4.11.20200930<br>
Expected behavior: use “watershed” effect with segment editor extra effects extensions<br>
Actual behavior: segment editor</p>
<p>Hello! I´m a PhD student and I need to segment a teeth like you show me in the forum. But I cannot do it like you because I don’t have the tool watershed;so my results are unsatisfactory. How can I get your same tools with 3D slicer? Thank you for everything</p>

<p>Go to the “Extension Manager” → “Install Extensions” then search for “SegmentEditorExtra” with the right upper search textbox. Install and restart Slicer.</p>

<p>Thank you for your answer, but I can’t install them because they say me that I need an app to download. Do I need an specific  program or app or similar? Thanks</p>

<p>It needs a dependency: MarkuptoModels extension. When you install the SegmentEditorExtra a notification appears asking to install the dependency.</p>
