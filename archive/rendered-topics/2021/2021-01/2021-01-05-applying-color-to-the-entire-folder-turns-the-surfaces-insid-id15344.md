<p>Applying color to the entire folder which contains multiple segmentations and segments in these segmentations, turns the surfaces inside out! flips verticals in 3d models why?</p>
<p>in error log only this shows many times:<br>
GetCategoryInTerminology: Failed to find category ‘Tissue’ in terminology ‘Segmentation category and type - 3D Slicer General Anatomy list’</p>
<p>DeserializeTerminologyEntry: Failed to get terminology category</p>
