<p>Hello,</p>
<p>in pedicle screw simulator, the length / width definition is mismatched. I.e. the model you chose with length of 700 and thickness of 50 in the menu is actually a 50 mm long screw of 7 mm thickness. That also makes sense because it is nearer to the screws that we use clinically.</p>
<p>Is there a github repo that gets compiled into this extension? Is this the one from lassoan?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Amir</p>
