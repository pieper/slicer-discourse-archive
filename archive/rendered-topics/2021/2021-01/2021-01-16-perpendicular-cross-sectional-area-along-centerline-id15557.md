<p>I need a perpendicular cross sectional area along centerline in vessel segmentation model.</p>
<p>I can extract centerline using VMTK extension and get diameter along centerline using centerline metrics extension.</p>
<p>However, I don’t know how to automatically measure the perpendicular cross sectional area’s’ along extracted centerline.</p>
<p>It will be very useful to determine the appropriate stent size in stenotic curved vassel.</p>
