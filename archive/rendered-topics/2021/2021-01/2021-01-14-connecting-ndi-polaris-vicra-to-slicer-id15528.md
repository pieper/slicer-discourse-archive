<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I’m trying to connect my NDI Polaris Vicra into Slicer using OpenIGTLinkIF. However, I’m not quite sure how to really set this up. I understand that I need to use PLUS to do it - but not sure how to connect this to Slicer either.</p>
<p>Does anyone have a step by step guide of this?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>You’ll need to install the SlicerOpenIGTLink connection to communicate with PLUS.</p>
<p>After that you can follow the tutorial on the SlicerIGT website, specifically  the “Hardware connections” tutorial.: <a href="http://www.slicerigt.org/wp/user-tutorial/" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">User tutorial | SlicerIGT</a>. You can try connecting to the Vicra using the “NDI Polaris tracker with passive markers” config file.</p>
