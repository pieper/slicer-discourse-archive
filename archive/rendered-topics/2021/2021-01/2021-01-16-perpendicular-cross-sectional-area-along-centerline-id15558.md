<p>Operating system: windows<br>
Slicer version: 4.11<br>
Expected behavior:<br>
Actual behavior:<br>
I had done segmentation of vessel and extract centerline with VMTK tool kit<br>
With centerline metrics, i was able to get diameter of vessel along centerline<br>
(Radius of inscribed sphere). However, clinically, when clinicians plans to do stent insertion, we need to know cross sectional area along to centerline to determine the size of stent.<br>
I have trouble with calculate the cross sectional area perpendicular to center line<br>
Is there any way to automatically calculate perpendicular cross sectional area along centerline ?</p>
