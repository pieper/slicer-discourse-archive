<p>Hello everybody,</p>
<p>I would like to know which of these ten methods (algorithms) belong to the global and which to the local threshold value?</p>

<p>The difference between global and local is not yet clear to me</p>
<p>Many thanks for the help</p>

<p>All of these methods use the entire image to compute the threshold value.</p>
