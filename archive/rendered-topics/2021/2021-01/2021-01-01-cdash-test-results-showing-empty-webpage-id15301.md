<p>I’ve noticed that I’m unable to review specific test output across all platforms on the Slicer CDash. I can see which tests have pass/failed, but the specific test case output is just an empty webpage. <a href="http://slicer.cdash.org/test/16106895" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">http://slicer.cdash.org/test/16106895</a> is a link to an example empty webpage where there would usually be test results.</p>
<p>Is this a configuration issue related to the update to the latest CDash version?</p>
<p>CC’ing Kitware who I think manages the CDash: <a class="mention" href="/u/jcfr">@jcfr</a></p>
