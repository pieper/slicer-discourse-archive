<p>What are the parameters for a good reconstruction of the lumbo sacral spine?<br>
I mean the requirements for the images, it could be MRI or CT scan, such as spacing between slices, image resolution, etc.<br>
I don’t know if there is a chart or guide to know this parameters</p>
<p>Thanks  in advance</p>
