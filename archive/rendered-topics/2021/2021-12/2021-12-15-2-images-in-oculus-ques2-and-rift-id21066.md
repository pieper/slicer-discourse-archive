<p>Hello!</p>
<p>I tried to use the VR extension of Slicer and I get two images (One per eye).  I am running steam VR.  I am sure it is just a setting.  Thanks in advance for your advice.</p>

<p>I’m not sure what you mean exactly, as you expect to get two images (one per eye). Could you post an image of what you see?</p>

<p>Its making one image per eye but the two images are seperated in the oculus So i see two skulls instead of one and its not stereoscopic</p>
