hello,<br>
I have a question about the extracted features by Radiomics extension.<br>
when I resample a MRI sequence, for some sapcing -dimensions it extracts 140 features instead of routine 130 features?<br>
what can be the reason and how can I fix this problem?<br>
thank you.</p>

<p>What does the log say? Should be an error somewhere. Which features are omitted?</p>
