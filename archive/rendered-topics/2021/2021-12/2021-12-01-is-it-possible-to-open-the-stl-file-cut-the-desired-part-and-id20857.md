<p>Hello all<br>
I want to cut the stl file as much as I want and save it.<br>
I cut and saved the dcm file, but I’m not sure how to do the stl.<br>
Can you tell me if it’s possible?</p>
<p>Thanks to read.</p>

<p>You can use Dynamic Modeler module in recent Slicer versions to edit surface meshes directly.</p>
<p>If you work with closed surfaces then there are many more editing tools for them in Segment Editor module. Your can export segments directly to STL files.</p>

<p>Thank you for your kind reply always <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=10" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>It’s a different question from the text. I am working on various attempts and Slicer Study to create loadable_moudle.<br>
When designing a GUI with Qt and creating a function that connects it (ex: segmentation editor’s result), can you advise me how to write the code using it?</p>

<p>I don’t understand this question, but it does not seem to be related to this topic, so I would suggest to create a new topic and describe what you want to do in more detail and also give a high-level overview of your overall goal.</p>
