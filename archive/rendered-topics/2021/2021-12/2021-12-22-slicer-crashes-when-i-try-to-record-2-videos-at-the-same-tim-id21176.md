<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am trying to record 2 videos at the same time using the python APIs.<br>
If I record just one video, the recording works properly, but if I immediatelly start a second recording Slicer crashes.<br>
However if I wait some seconds between starting the first and the second recording and then I wait some seconds between stopping the first and the second recording, both the recordings are completed properly and Slicer doesn’t crash.</p>
<p>Do you know how to solve this issue?</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

<p>Can you provide a simplest possible Python script that reproduces the issue?</p>
