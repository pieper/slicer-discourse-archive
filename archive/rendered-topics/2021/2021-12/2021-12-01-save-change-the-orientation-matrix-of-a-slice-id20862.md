<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I would like to develop a modul, that transform the green slice view into the cochlear view.<br>
For this I have to make an training database, thus I want to save the orientation matrix of the green slice after I transform it into the cochlear view manually. How can I save this matrix, for example to excel, or notebook?</p>
<p>Thanks for helping!<br>
Best Regards!<br>
Bence</p>

<p>Have you looked at the Volume Reslice Driver module in the SlicerIGT extension?</p>
