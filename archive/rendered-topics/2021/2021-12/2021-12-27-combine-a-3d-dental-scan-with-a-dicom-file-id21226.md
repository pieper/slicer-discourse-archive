<p>hay everybody i wold like to create surgical guides in dentistry<br>
the problem is that the patient have crowns and there are a lot of artifacts, so i cannot create a precise STL file or slice the teeth correctly.</p>
<p>i can do a 3D scan of the crowns<br>
is there a way to combine the 3D scan with the cbct and have one output as an STL?</p>
