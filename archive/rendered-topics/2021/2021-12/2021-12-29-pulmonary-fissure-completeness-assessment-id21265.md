<p>Hello friends,</p>
<p>The point here is to quantify the completeness of the fissure, as the main objective is lung resection surgery planning.<br>
I have assessed the great paper entitled “An open-source framework for pulmonary fissure completeness assessment”. However, I don’t find any practical workflow to follow.<br>
Does anyone know a workflow to segment the pulmonary fissure?</p>
