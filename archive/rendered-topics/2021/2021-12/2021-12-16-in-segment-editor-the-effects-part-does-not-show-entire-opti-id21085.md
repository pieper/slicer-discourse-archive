<p>Operating system: 64 bit windows 10 Pro<br>
Slicer version: 4.11.20210226<br>
Expected behavior:  I expect the <em>Effects</em> part on segment editor to include the entire options.<br>
Actual behavior: the <em>Effects</em> part only includes a few option tools on the stable version that I downloaded.</p>

<p>It depends on what extra effects you need but you can get some additional effects by installing the “SegmentEditorExtraEffects” module from the Extensions Manager. Other effect add ons are also found in the Extensions Manager.</p>
