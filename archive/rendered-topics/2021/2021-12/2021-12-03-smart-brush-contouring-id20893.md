<p>Is there anything similar in Slicer to Smart Brush found in BrainLab elements contouring?</p>

<p>Yes. The corresponding tool in 3D Slicer is Grow from seeds:</p>
<div class="youtube-onebox lazy-video-container" data-video-id="cybL5A0w3hw" data-video-title="Brain tumor segmentation on MRI in 1 minute" data-provider-name="youtube">
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cybL5A0w3hw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">

  </a>
</div>

<p>It is as fast as the Smart Brush and much more powerful, as it allows segmentation of any number of structures at once, allows specifying intensity range, can even restrict growing to remain inside an arbitrary region, allows editing in 3D, etc.</p>
