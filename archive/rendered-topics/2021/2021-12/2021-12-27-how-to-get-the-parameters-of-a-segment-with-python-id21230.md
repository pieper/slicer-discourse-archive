<p>Hi everyone,<br>
I’m using a Slicer version 4.13.0-2021-12-01 for Ubuntu18.04.<br>
I want to get the Maximum slicer, length and short diameter, CT value and maximum surface area of a segment with python. But I have no idea about that.</p>
<p>Thank you very much for your support!</p>

<p>I don’t understand exactly what you want to calculate for the segment using python but there are some examples in the <a href="https://slicer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer_guide/script_repository.html#quantifying-segments" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">script repository</a> which may be similar to what you are trying to do.</p>
<p>Let me know if you need any more specific help and I may be able to figure it out</p>
