<p>I missed the registration deadline. Can I still join the workshop or will it be recorded?</p>

<p>Yes, I was told by the AWS team that they can still accept new registrations today.</p>
<p>Also yes, the workshop will be recorded and made available.</p>
<p>For anyone who has signed up, we’ll be emailing around instructions later today.</p>
