<p>Hello, I’m looking for a way to visualize Line Markups, as a projection in all 2D views… Currently, when the projection option is active, the line is only visible on the surrounding slices, but I would like to see the line in every slice. So far, I’m using the Markups to Model extension as a workaround, and selecting the projection mode in the slice display for the “Line Model”. But it requires too many steps. Any shorter solution would be very appreciated.</p>
<p>Best Juan</p>
