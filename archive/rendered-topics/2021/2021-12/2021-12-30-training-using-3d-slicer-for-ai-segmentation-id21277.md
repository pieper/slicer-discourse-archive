<p>I would like to learn how to use the 3D slicer software for professional-level AI segmentation of Anatomical models in various colors for all fields of Medical segments. My question is;</p>
<ol>
<li>Is there training available to learn the use of 3D Slicer with AI segmentation?</li>
<li>Can the segmented models be 3D printed in multi-color as segmented?</li>
</ol>

<p>Once the segmentations are available you can export them in various formats - the ability to print them is beyond the scope of 3D Slicer but lots of people do this with a variety of other tools.</p>
