<p>I have tried reading an image set and have run into a couple problems. First, I found that it wouldn’t read until I moved the folder to much earlier in the file path. I’ve now corrected this. However, once the images have been read, the viewer only shows me 1 image in 2D. I have isotropic TOF data, and it certainly reads as 3D in different software. The data is anonymised and saved as .IMA, which is DICOM but I don’t know if this would be the source of the error?</p>
