I have been trying to find a way to redock the module panel, but still unsuccessful…<br>
Now I cannot even access to the main screen to do anything.<br>
Could anyone kindly help me, please?</p>
<p>Thank you in advance.</p>

<p>Double click on ‘3D Slicer’.</p>

<p>Thank you. I read that but I could not find the bar before. Now I have realised that the page just went further than the screen every time I started the software, and it was just not possible to grab the bar.</p>

<p>In the MenuBar you could also do View-&gt;reset to default and it would also redock the module panel. As well as View-&gt;Module Panel.</p>
