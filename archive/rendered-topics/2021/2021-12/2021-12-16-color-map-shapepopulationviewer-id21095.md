<p>Operating system: Windows 10 Pro, 64-bit<br>
Slicer version: 4.11</p>
<p>I first constructed surface models from CBCTs. Then, I superimposed the two skull models, before and after, using CMF surface registration. After that, I moved on to model to model distance module, I used the after model as the source model, and the before model as target model. After running model to model distance, I saved the file under the name “ColorMap”. Here is where the problem happens, I open ShapePopulationViewer to create a Color Map with distances to quantify the changes between the superimposed before and after models. However, whenever I try to load the “ColorMap” file onto ShapePopulationViewer, only the after model appears.</p>
<p>In short, I am unable to find a way to load the superimposed before and after models onto ShapePopulationViewer to create a color map.</p>
