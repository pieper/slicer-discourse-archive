<p>Is it possible to change this file? I’ve tried to use a params file.yaml converted in json but it doesn’t work. Any suggestions?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>What is this “params” file? Which module uses it?</p>

<p>I mean in radiomics module. Where you can choose parameter and even upload a personal file, I don’t know why but it can’t read anything…</p>

<p>Can you post a stack trace or log (bottom right in slicer or help&gt;report a bug)?<br>
It should be able to read the yaml file. If not, it at least should post some info on why it is unable to.</p>
