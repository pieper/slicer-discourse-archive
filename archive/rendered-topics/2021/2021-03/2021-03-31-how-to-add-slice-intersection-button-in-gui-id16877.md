<p>I’m trying to create a button in my module that works just like the slice intersection checkbox. When I click on the button I want to toggle the slice intersection visibility. What would I put in def onClick() or how do I toggle slice intersection using python?</p>

<p>Hi <a class="mention" href="/u/akshay_pillai">@akshay_pillai</a>, there is an example of toggling slice intersections in the <a href="https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/Nightly/ScriptRepository" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Slicer script repository</a>. It involves setting the slice intersection visibility. Let us know how it goes.</p>
