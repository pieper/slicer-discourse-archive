<p>There is a plug-in Draw in the segment editor. When you use it, you need to click the right mouse button to paint. I now want to connect the slicer through the hand-painted board. Is there a way to automatically paint when the line stops, without clicking the right mouse button.<img src="https://us1.discourse-cdn.com/flex002/uploads/slicer/original/3X/2/4/241266deb90eb034d9c927e3c570465ce69f41a9.jpeg" alt="捕获" data-base62-sha1="596C6RlkWskkxYZ4vyMuxRVEbLH" width="393" height="305"></p>

<p>To allow drawing using multiple straight line segments, the drawing does not complete when you release the mouse button.</p>
<p>The behavior that you are looking for is available in Scissors effect (symmetric mode, 0 thickness).</p>
