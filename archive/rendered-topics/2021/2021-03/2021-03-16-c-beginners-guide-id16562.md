<p>Hi all, I just started developing with 3DSlicer. I successfully created a C++ (loadable) extension and can load it into 3DSlicer. I was wondering if there is a basic guide on how to interact with the data nodes, other extensions etc available? I looked at some of the source codes of other extensions, but a lot of them are in python. I would be very grateful if you can point me in the right direction of some good C++ related resources/extensions/videos which I can learn from. Thanks!</p>
