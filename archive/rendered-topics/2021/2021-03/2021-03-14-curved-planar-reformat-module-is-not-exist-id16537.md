<p>Operating system: Windows 10<br>
Slicer version: 29738, 4.11<br>
Hello everyone,<br>
I’ve recently started to use 3D Slicer and was looking for a curved planar reformat to straighten the aorta in a planar, but I could not install it as it is not found in my extensions manager and sandbox as well. my slicer version is 29738<br>
May I get some guidance, please?</p>
<p>Thank you so much</p>
