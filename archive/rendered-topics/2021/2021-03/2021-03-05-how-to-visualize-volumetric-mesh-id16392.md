<p>Hi everyone</p>
<p>I am sorry about this question, But after generate the Mesh with the Segment Mesher, How can I visualize the  Volumetric Mesh created?</p>

<p>You can visualize volumetric meshes exactly the same way as surface meshes. You will only see difference between surface and volumetric meshes in 3D if you cut the model; and in slice views if you display slice intersections.</p>
