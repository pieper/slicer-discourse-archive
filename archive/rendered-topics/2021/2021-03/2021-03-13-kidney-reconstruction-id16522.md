Slicer version:4.11<br>
Hi, I use 3d slicer for kidney reconstruction and 3d printing. I want to take a section of the organ and have the inner anatomy of the kidney. Is there a way to do this , or 3d slicer extracts only the contour of the mesh?</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

<p>You can cut arbitrary sections either in the segmentation (using Segment Editor module) or in the model that you export from the segmentation (using Dynamic Modeler module).</p>
