<p>You can download it using this link:<br>
<a href="https://download.slicer.org/?offset=-209" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://download.slicer.org/?offset=-209</a></p>
<p>Note that the offset I found for May 30 only has the Windows version for that date, the versions for the other platforms are slightly different.</p>
