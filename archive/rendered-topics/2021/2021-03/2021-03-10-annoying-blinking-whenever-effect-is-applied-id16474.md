<p>during segmentation  I’m getting this annoying blinking whenever effect is applied like the model disappears and returns in seconds.  sometimes less sometimes more. first time i thought i deleted the segment.  mostly noticed with smoothening brush</p>

<p>Which Slicer versions do you experience this with? Can you check both latest stable and preview releases? Can you take a screen capture video of it?</p>
