<p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>I have downloaded the latest stable version 4.11.20210226 and I try to install the SlicerJupiter extension from the Extention Manager. My current operating system is Ubuntu 20.04.1 LTS.<br>
I tried the search mode in All, and looking for it into each category, but I can not find the extension.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for any help you could provide me.</p>
<p>PS: SlicerJupiter worked fine with my previous OS Windows10</p>

<p>Thanks for reporting. The extension indeed failed to build for recent Slicer releases on Linux. I’ll fix this soon. You can follow the status of this issue here: <a href="https://github.com/Slicer/SlicerJupyter/issues/59">https://github.com/Slicer/SlicerJupyter/issues/59</a></p>
