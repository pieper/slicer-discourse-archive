<p>Dear all,</p>
<p>I have segmented a DICOM file in 3DSlicer. I want to export the scan and also the segmentation (the labels) in nifti format. I am not sure how to do it using 3DSlicer.<br>
Can anyone help me with the relevant module that I should use and probably mention which steps I need to complete to properly export the scan and the labels for the segmented regions?</p>
<p>Thanks for your help</p>

<p>It should be pretty straightforward:</p>
