<p>When I try to select a CT series that I have uploaded I receive the following message “selected files listed in the database cannot be found on disk”. Any idea what I am doing wrong?</p>

<p>This means your files were probably on a removable disk that’s no longer available or were otherwise deleted or moved since they were indexed.</p>
