<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I’m unfamiliar with ventilation heterogeneity displayed in CIP parenchymal analysis. Can I refer to the calculation formula of ventilation heterogeneity?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>I would also like to know what is meant by ventilation heterogeneity please. This is not a familiar term to clinicians and could involve HU, specific volume, specific gas volume, or other units.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
