<p>Two full time post-doctoral candidates are sought to work at the University of South Carolina under supervision of Dr. Chris Rorden (<a href="http://www.mricro.com" rel="nofollow noopener">www.mricro.com</a>). Our goal is to understand brain changes associated with healthy aging and stroke recovery.  We are particularly interested in understanding neuroimaging, electrophysiological and genetic biomarkers of cognitive reserve and flexibility. We have already acquired data from hundreds of individuals who have suffered stroke, and are acquiring data from 600 neurologically healthy individuals.</p>
<p>We are seeking to employ scientists to be involved with the spatial processing of imaging data and the statistical analyses of results. Relevant research skills includes experience with normal aging and/or stroke recovery. The ideal applicant will have experience with neuroimaging data analysis (e.g., SPM, FSL) scripting languages (e.g., Python, Matlab), supercomputing clusters, and machine learning.</p>
<p>Our team is committed to understanding aging and advancing stroke care. Our group is highly collaborative and productive. Members benefit from the diverse skills from committed clinicians and scientists. New members will work closely with our NIH P50 aphasia recovery center (<a href="https://cstar.sc.edu" rel="nofollow noopener">https://cstar.sc.edu</a>). This environment is ideal for developing translational skills. We have state-of-the-art facilities including a Siemens 3T Prisma with dedicated research time.</p>
<p>The position requires a PhD in a cognitive-science or a related field such as Psychology, Neuroscience, Computer Science, Biomedical Engineering, or Communication Disorders. Interested candidates should contact Chris Rorden (chris.rorden@sc.edu).</p>
