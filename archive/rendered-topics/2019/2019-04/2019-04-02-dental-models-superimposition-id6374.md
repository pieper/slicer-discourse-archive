<p>Operating system:<br>
Slicer version: Slicer 3D CMF 4.0<br>
Expected behavior:<br>
Actual behavior:</p>
<p>I used model to model distance to superimpose dental models. How does the software superimpose them? Are there multiple landmarks? How the discrepancy between the 2 models are calculated? Is there a number of points in each model?</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

<p>Did you find an answer?<br>
I’m trying to superimpose 2 different stl files, and I’m wondering if there is the possibility to choose a fixed point to superimpose.<br>
Thanks for answering</p>
