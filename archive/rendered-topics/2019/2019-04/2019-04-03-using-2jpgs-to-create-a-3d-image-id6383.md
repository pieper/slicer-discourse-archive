<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>Im just recently returning to using SLicer and need to a way to create a 3D image from at least 2(doronal and saggital) and max 4 JPGs. This would be using a smartphone to capture images of a leg. I looked into segment editor but it seemed like that was more for a larger series of photos. Is that the tool I should be looking into? Thanks for your help!</p>
