<p>Hi, I’m trying to package 3dslicer for ArchLinux from the binary tarball. Currently, we get a download url <a href="https://download.slicer.org/bitstream/944596" rel="nofollow noopener">https://download.slicer.org/bitstream/944596</a>, which is not related to the version of 3dslicer. Could we have a url related to the version? Something like <a href="https://download.slicer.org/bitstream/3dslicer-4.10.1.tar.gz" rel="nofollow noopener">https://download.slicer.org/bitstream/3dslicer-4.10.1.tar.gz</a>. It would be of great help to automatically create a package for ArchLinux. Than you.</p>

<p>Sorry, somehow this request got missed. Is this still relevant?</p>

<p><a href="http://Download.slicer.org" rel="nofollow noopener">Download.slicer.org</a> redirects to kitware, and doesn’t handle the bits. It would have to happen on the kitware side.</p>

<p>Oh, I think I found a way to download the latest 3D Slicer. I somehow found that I could download the latest release for Linux with url <code>http://download.slicer.org/download?os=linux&amp;stability=release</code>. This works for me. see also <a href="https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/4.10/FAQ#Where_can_I_download_Slicer.3F" rel="nofollow noopener">FAQ</a> if needed.</p>
