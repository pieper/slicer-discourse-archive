<p>Slicer works with any OpenVR (SteamVR) compatible headset.</p>
<p>Probably you can hook up your Oculus Go with SteamVR (with adapters such as <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/how-play-steamvr-games-oculus-go" rel="nofollow noopener">ALVR</a>), but the experience will be extremely poor/unusable.</p>
<p>I’ve tried Slicer virtual reality with Samsung Gear VR (using <a href="https://discourse.slicer.org/t/connecting-htc-vive-with-3d-slicer/1299/27">vridge</a>) but after some initial enthusiasm I realized that it is so limited compared to a proper VR system (HTC Vive, Windows MR, Oculus Rift) that it just does not make sense. Especially because you can get a Windows Mixed Reality headset with 2 controllers for $300.</p>

<p>Anything that supports SteamVR should work with Slicer.</p>
<p>I think this guide could be useful: <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/vridge-oculus-go-steamvr" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.windowscentral.com/vridge-oculus-go-steamvr</a></p>
