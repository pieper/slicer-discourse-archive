<p>Hi there, I’m totally new to slicer. All I’d like to do is generate ROI masks to be used by another program. They need to be of the ‘dicom-RT’ format.</p>
<p>I’ve uploaded the CT as a dicom, and created a simple spherical segmentation (using the segmentations module), choosing the CT as the master volume.</p>
<p>I then go to the ‘converters’ module and select create a dicom series. I select the segmentation I just made and hit ‘Apply’. This however creates an unenhanced dicom, and it doesn’t appear to be of the right format. Does anyone know how to export a segmentation as a dicom-RT? Any help would be greatly appreciated!!</p>
