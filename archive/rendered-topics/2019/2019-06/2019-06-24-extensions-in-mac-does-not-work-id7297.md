<p>Hi</p>
<p>I cannot install extensions in Mac.<br>
Tried through extensions managers- says error, check whether slicer is installed properly<br>
Then tried manual installation , as explained in previous posts<br>
Could you please advise</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>Tom</p>

<p>What version of Slicer are you using? What extensions are you trying to install?</p>
<p>Did you build your Slicer from source? or did you download from <a href="http://download.slicer.org" rel="nofollow noopener">download.slicer.org</a>?</p>
