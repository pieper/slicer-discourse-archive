<p>Operating system:<br>
Slicer version:<br>
Expected behavior:<br>
Actual behavior:<br>
Is there anyone out there that would be willing to help me better understand 3D slicer. I already have a basic understanding and would like to understand it better. I need to know the “How” and “Why” things work the way they do.  I would also like to investigate some of the other features of Slicer. We would be willing to pay for your time.</p>

<p>An option could be to attend the upcoming <a href="https://github.com/NA-MIC/ProjectWeek/tree/master/PW31_2019_Boston" rel="nofollow noopener">Slicer Project Week</a> that will take place in Boston next week.</p>
<p>That said, considering you seem to be at the University of Washington, I am wondering if it would make sense to connect with <a class="mention" href="/u/muratmaga">@muratmaga</a> .</p>
