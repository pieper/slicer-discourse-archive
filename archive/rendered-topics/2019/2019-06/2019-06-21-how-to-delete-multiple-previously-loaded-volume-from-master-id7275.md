<p>Can you please let me know how can I simultaneously delete previously loaded multiple “volume” from “Master volume”<br>
In the image there are 5 DICOM folders and I want to delete 4. Currently I am selecting each file and pressing “Delete current Volume”. So can you suggest an option to simultaneously delete 4.</p>

<p>In Data module you can select multiple nodes (using Shift+click or Ctrl+click) and delete them all at once by right-clicking and choosing “Delete”.</p>
