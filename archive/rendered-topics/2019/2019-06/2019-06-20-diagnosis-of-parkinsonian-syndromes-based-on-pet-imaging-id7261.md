</div></a></div> Clinical diagnosis of Parkinsonian Syndromes is challenging.<br>
PET imaging using F-18-DOPA is a promissing tool for the diagnosis, but visual evaluation of images is difficult.<br>
I’m a Nuclear Medicine Physician and I’m asking support for the development of a tool for CADx of Parkinsonian Syndromes based on F-18-DOPA PET images.<br>
Please let me know if you may be interested in a partnership.<br>
Thanks,<br>
Tiago</p>

<p>Welcome to the Slicer community. There are many ways of potential collaborations. Usually the easiest is to start something small and very specific. For example, look around what tools are available in Slicer that might be relevant for you, try them, and ask specific questions about how to use or improve them.</p>
<p>You may also consider coming to one of the <a href="https://projectweek.na-mic.org/" rel="nofollow noopener">Slicer project weeks</a> where you can work together with many Slicer core developers and users in person for a week, on problems that you bring. There will be one close to you in <a href="https://projectweek.na-mic.org/PW33_2020_GranCanaria/" rel="nofollow noopener">Gran Canaria, Spain in January 2020</a>.</p>
