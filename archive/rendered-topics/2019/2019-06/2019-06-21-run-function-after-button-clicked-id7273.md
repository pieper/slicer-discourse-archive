<p>Hi there!<br>
I am wondering if there is any functionality to track if the button on the UI was clicked? For example, I want to run a computation each time after fiducial is placed</p>

<p>You can automatically run computations when a node changed by adding an observer. See <a href="https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/Nightly/Training#Tutorials_for_software_developers" rel="nofollow noopener">PerkLab programming tutorials</a> for details and examples.</p>
