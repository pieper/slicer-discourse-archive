<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Just wondering if anyone can tell me if there is a way to use the T1 Mapping module using two separate data sets for each of the flip angles utilized (2,15 degrees).</p>
<p>From the Documentation, the input image requires: “A multivolume node containing multiple flip angles image loaded using DICOM module”. However, my data sets (3D GR) were obtained separately and thus have different acquisition time stamps.</p>
<p>Any help would be appreciated! Desiring to implement T1 Map into the PK Analysis Module since my K-trans maps generated are not looking great without the T1 map overlaid!</p>
<p>Thanks!<br>
Maddie</p>
