<p>Earlier today, <a class="mention" href="/u/andinet_enquobahrie">@Andinet_Enquobahrie</a> mentioned this conference and I was wondering if anyone was planning to attend or if any one submitted a paper.</p>

<p>I did, also volunteered for the organization. I guess I’m a bit too late… I’m planning to submit and attend for next year in Montreal: <a href="https://2020.midl.io/" rel="nofollow noopener">https://2020.midl.io/</a></p>
