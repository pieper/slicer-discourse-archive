<p>A new effect has been added to the Segment Editor Extra Effects to split a volume using a segmentation. The output is a volume for each segment, cropped to the extent of the segment with optional padding. This can be used for tasks such as the separation of multiple specimen in a single scan.</p>
<p>This effect is available with the nightly Slicer version in the SegmentEditorExtraEffects extension. A brief demo is posted here: <a href="https://youtu.be/GtP4DJtMjnk" rel="nofollow noopener">https://youtu.be/GtP4DJtMjnk</a></p>
<p>Thanks <a class="mention" href="/u/lassoan">@lassoan</a> for your help with this.</p>
