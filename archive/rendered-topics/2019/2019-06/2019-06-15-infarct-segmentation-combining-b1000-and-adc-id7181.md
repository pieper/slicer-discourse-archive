<p>Hi,<br>
I would like to know if I can combine two mri sequences for segmentation process. Currently I am using one sequence for this purpose.</p>

<p>In Segment Editor module, you can switch between master volumes any time. So, you can segment some structures or define a mask based on one volume, then continue defining or refining segments based on a different volume.</p>
