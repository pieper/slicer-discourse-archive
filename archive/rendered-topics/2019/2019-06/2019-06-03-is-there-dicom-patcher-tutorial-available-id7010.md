<p>Thanks Andras. Laura is creating a tutorial for using dcm2niix inside Slicer, and one step is using the patcher in case there are several DICOM scans in one directory. Is there any website or anything we should point to in the tutorial for people who want more information about the patcher module?</p>

<p>I’ve added a page on Slicer read-the-docs: <a href="https://slicer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/module_dicompatcher.html" rel="nofollow noopener">https://slicer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/module_dicompatcher.html</a></p>
<p>I’ll add more details to the page as needed.</p>
