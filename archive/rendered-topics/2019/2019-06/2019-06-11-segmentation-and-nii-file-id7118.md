<p>Sure, it should work.  You’ll probably need to check the <a href="https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/4.10/SlicerApplication/LoadingData#Show_Options" rel="nofollow noopener">Label Map option when loading</a>.  If you have trouble maybe you can share an example (no patient info though).</p>
