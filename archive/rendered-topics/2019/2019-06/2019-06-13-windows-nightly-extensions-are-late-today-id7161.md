<p>Hi all:</p>
<p>Due to some issues on the windows factory, we have had to re-trigger the nightly extension builds.  So extensions will be coming online over the next hours.  The windows nightly installer is available now, at <a href="http://download.slicer.org" rel="nofollow noopener">download.slicer.org</a> (not affected by the current <a href="http://slicer.org" rel="nofollow noopener">slicer.org</a> outage)</p>
