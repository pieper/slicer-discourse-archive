<p>Operating system:windows 10<br>
Slicer version:4.11.0<br>
Expected behavior: during volume rendering it should show the 3D model<br>
Actual behavior: when i click eye icon for volume rendering, the software close off itself during loading.</p>

<p>Does volume rendering work with the MRHead sample data set (available in Sample Data module)?</p>
<p>What graphics card and CPU do you have?</p>
<p>Is there any error or warning message in the application log? (menu: Help/Report a bug)</p>

<p>Volume Rendering takes a lot of computer resource.<br>
I’m on Windows 10 with 16GB RAM and without external graphics card, VolumeRendering is slow on my machine.<br>
So verify that you have enough RAM to run this module by monitoring the usage of RAM with Tasks Manager.</p>
