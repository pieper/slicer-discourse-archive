<p>Operating system: Windows 10<br>
Slicer version: 4.10.2<br>
Expected behavior: 3D Casting of MRI slices<br>
Actual behavior: Casting looks shifted and overlapped, may have something to do with the fact that one slice window has slices that rotate around a plane instead of slicing through that plane. How do I correct this?</p>

<p>What do you mean by “casting”? Can you attach a screenshot?</p>
