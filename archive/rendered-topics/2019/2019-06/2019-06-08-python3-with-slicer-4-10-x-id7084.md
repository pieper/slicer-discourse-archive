<p>i try to package slicer for fedora and have a problem with python.<br>
fedora is switching to python3 and already removed a lot of python2 packages.<br>
are there any plans for supporting python3 with 4.10.x (the stable branch of slicer)?</p>

<p>Slicer-4.10 and earlier uses Python2, Slicer-4.11 and later uses Python3. We do not plan to change this, so choose your Slicer version according to what Python version you need.</p>
