<p>What is a .voi file? What software generates it? You could consider segmenting the PET image in Slicer’s <a href="https://slicer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/module_segmenteditor.html" rel="nofollow noopener">Segment Editor module</a> instead.</p>

<p>Hi <a class="mention" href="/u/lassoan">@lassoan</a> ,<br>
In my case, I have some Volumes of Interest (VOI) files with point coordinates drawn by <a href="https://www.pmod.com/web/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">POMD software</a>. Can I use 3D Slicer to open the VOI files?</p>
