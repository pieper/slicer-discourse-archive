<p>Advances in machine learning and deep learning have made it possible to embed the knowledge of experienced physician/radiologist into computational models and have shown state-of-the art performance in various image analysis tasks including computer-assisted detection, diagnosis, and prognosis of several forms of cancers including prostate cancer. However, models are not fully integrated with the current standard of care in clinic. We have developed <a href="http://prostatecancer.ai/studylist" rel="nofollow noopener">prostatecancer.ai</a> which enables deployment of AI models in a web-browser while simultaneously providing standard image viewing and reporting schemes.</p>
