<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>I have been using SlicerRT so I can access the delineations (segmentations) of individual organs that have been defined in a RTstruct file (also DICOM format).</p>
<p>There is a structure - an applicator (used for brachytherapy) - that is saved as a BLOB file into a DICOM format RTPlan file.</p>
<p>I was wondering whether anyone has managed to open a BLOB file from a DICOM using slicer?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>I don’t think BLOB file is a standard DICOM information object. If you can share an example file then we can have a closer look.</p>
