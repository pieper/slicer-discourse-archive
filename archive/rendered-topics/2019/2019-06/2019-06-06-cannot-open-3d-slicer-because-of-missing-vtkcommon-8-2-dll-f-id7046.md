<p>Hi~,</p>
<p>3D slicer cannot be opened suddenly and it gave a warning message which said cannot find the vtkcommon-8.2.dll file. I reinstalled 3D slicer and still got that message. Could you help me to fixed it?</p>
<p>Best,<br>

<p>If you used something other than 4.10.2, then please try the latest stable: <a href="https://download.slicer.org/" rel="nofollow noopener">https://download.slicer.org/</a></p>

<p>Have you launched the application by running Slicer.exe?<br>
Does vtkCommon-8.2.dll exist?</p>

<p>Yes. But it showed the same warning. I check the bin folder. vtkCommon-8.2.dll does not exist.</p>

<p>Do you have any anti-virus product installed? Maybe the dll is mistaken for malware and quarantined.</p>

<p>Yes. It works after I close the anti-virus product. Thank you.</p>
