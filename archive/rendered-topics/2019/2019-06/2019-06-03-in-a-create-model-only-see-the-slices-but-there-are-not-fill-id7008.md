<p>I paint slice by slice in coronal cut using the gradient to do a model of a tooth, but when I make the model only are the slice and not the complete model filling between the slices.  Thank you very much!</p>

<p>Can you attach a screenshot showing the segment editor module and the viewers in 4-up layout (showing 3 orthogonal slices and 3D)?</p>
