<p>Hi all!</p>
<p>We will be initiating the Slicer 4.10.2 patch release this week.  Among other things, this will fix the landmark registration bug in the previous Markups design.  The roadmap for this release is <a href="https://issues.slicer.org/roadmap_page.php?version_id=40">here</a>.  Commits currently planned to be backported can be found <a href="https://issues.slicer.org/view.php?id=4671">on this issue</a>.</p>
<p>We would also like to include any other well-scoped commits/fixes that the community thinks would be appropriate for the patch.</p>
<p>I am hoping to begin the release process on Thursday, but will make additional posts to confirm when the nightly build will be disabled for the release build.</p>

<p>Update:</p>
<p>I have finished backporting the requested fixes.  There will be no nightly build tonight on the factories so that we can generate the release packages!</p>

<p>Thanks for the update. It would be great if you could start a nightly build when you are done with the new stable release package, anytime during the day (we would need a new nightly release for testing some new experimental features in SlicerHeart). Thank you!</p>
