<p>Is there a way to map the border intensity values of a segmentation to the surface of a model as a texture in 3d slicer to highlight the surfaces dense regions?</p>

<p>You might want the <a href="https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/4.10/Modules/ProbeVolumeWithModel" rel="nofollow noopener">ProbeVolumeWithModel</a> module.</p>

<p>Also, can you display a colorbar with the hUnits being painted on the model?</p>
