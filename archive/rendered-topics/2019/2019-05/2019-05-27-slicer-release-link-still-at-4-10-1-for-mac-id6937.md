<p>Hi! Is this on purpose? Only Linux and Windows have updated links to download the new release here:<br>
<a href="https://download.slicer.org/" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://download.slicer.org/</a></p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Generating signed Mac package takes more time. See updates on 4.10.2 release <a href="https://discourse.slicer.org/t/schedule-for-slicer-4-10-2-patch-release/6783/5">here</a>.</p>

<p>Thanks! I’ve been asked by a few users, so now I know the answer.</p>
<p>Is there anything “wrong” with using the Mac 4.10.2 available from the “older releases” link on the download page? It’s just not signed yet?</p>

<p>The only difference between the current and final Mac release package should be the signature.</p>

<p>Yep.  Once the signed release is available we will update the link.</p>
