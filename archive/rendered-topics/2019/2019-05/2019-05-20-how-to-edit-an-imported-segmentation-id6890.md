<p>I want to import the scene in a project but when I import it I don’t know how to edit it, the segmentation is in the 3D view but I can’t edit because I’m not finding it in the segment editor as a new segment. I want to make a new segment whit the scene I previously saved.</p>

<p>You need to select a  master volume in order to edit a segmentation. Follow these instructions: <a href="https://discourse.slicer.org/t/3d-model-to-segmentation/5135/2" class="inline-onebox">3D model to segmentation</a></p>
