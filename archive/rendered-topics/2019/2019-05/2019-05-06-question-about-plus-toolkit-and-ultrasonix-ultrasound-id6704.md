<p>Good morning everyone,</p>
<p>I have an issue with transfering us images from my Ultrasonix probe (running on a 32 bit os) to my main working PC (64 bits os).</p>
<p>I have seen that people should use toolKitPlus on the 32 bit pc and Slicer on my 64 bit os… Using OpenIGTLink</p>
<p>I configured the Ultrasonix pc as a client and my main pc as a server (recieving images). But it doesn’t work…</p>
<p>Can someone give me a step-by-step manual about how to trasnfer images from one pc to another… ?</p>
<p>Thank you for your patience.</p>

<p>It does work. Since this problem only related to Plus, please <a href="https://github.com/PlusToolkit/PlusLib/issues/new">submit an issue on the GitHub project page</a>. Describe what software (and what version) you run and on what computer, and also upload <em>debug-level</em> logs of PlusServer to onedrive/dropbox/gdrive/etc. and post the link.</p>
