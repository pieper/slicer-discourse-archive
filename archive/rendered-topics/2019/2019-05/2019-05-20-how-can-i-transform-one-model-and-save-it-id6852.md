<p>I’m trying to rotate and translate a model. I’m using the tool Transforms, the problem is that i cant save the results. Any suggestion?</p>

<p>If you don’t see the effect of the transformation in the saved file then probably you have not hardened the transform on the node (without hardening, the transform is applied dynamically - model point positions are not changed).</p>
