<p>Hi to everyone! I’m pretty new with slicer and i have a little inconvenient with stl saving. I create an stl model of a human face starting from a Dicom generated by a CBCT. Final size is about 1.5 GB, too big for my workflow. Is there any method to reduce file size?</p>

Hi everyone, 
Is there a way to compress the size of 3D models before exporting them as STL or OBJ format. Sometimes these are about 100 MBs and its difficult to put them in presentations. 
Thanks, 
Sarv
