<p>Hi,<br>
I have some problems with the resolution of MRI set. After importing and uploading DICOM images, not all the views have the same resolution and some parts of the images are cut off, in particular the sagittal plane. How can I solve this problem?<br>
Thank you in advance</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://slicer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/user_interface.html#mouse-keyboard-shortcuts" rel="nofollow noopener">zoom out the view</a> a bit and/or align slice views with image axes (using <a href="https://discourse.slicer.org/t/segmentation-editor-how-to-disable-painting-on-adjacent-slices/1459/4">rotate to volume plane</a> function).</p>
