<p>I have a series of jpeg images from an MRI that contains both a series of axial plane slices and sagittal plane slices, I am doing volume renders of this MRI and am wondering if there is a way to specify the which slices are axial plane and which slices are sagittal plane. What I have found online so far is only examples using a series of slice from a single plane to do volume rendering in Slicer. Any advice would be appreciated! Thanks.</p>
