<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am trying to record virtual reality scene using obs studio. The steam VR app doesn’t show mirror option now, rather it shows display VR view that I checked. However, i am not sure which source to select in obs studio to record the scene. There are options of game view, window view among several others.<br>
Pls let me know what settings i need to select.<br>
Thanks for help!</p>

<p>I’ve noticed that since recent SteamVR updates, OBS Studio could not capture from the mirror screen but you can still capture your entire desktop, where you can display the VR mirror view.</p>

<p>Thanks Andras. I was able to change the option in OBS studio source recording to game recording and then pick option for mixed reality. It worked then.</p>
