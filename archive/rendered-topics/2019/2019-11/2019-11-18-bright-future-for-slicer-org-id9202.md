<p>Good morning,</p>
<p>What is the Future for <a href="http://Slicer.org" rel="nofollow noopener">Slicer.org</a>?</p>
<p>This technology saves lives. Seeing is believing with this software, the Volume differences is space age tech!</p>
<p>As i see it, this needs to be a standard. The Future IS having these images available, more in real time.</p>
<p>To do this, there must be an AI that can follow technitions routing to the final image with Volumes included. To eventually produce automation of software.</p>
<p>Imagine in 5 years, starting now, to gather this information and data.</p>
<p>Example: Eyes.<br>
Software will first recognize 4 points on cranium. This will give the azmyth coordinates. From there the software makes most decisions, to get to final images.</p>
<p>If this can be done, then it will be a standard.</p>
<p>I say start now, bright future ahead for <a href="http://slicer.org" rel="nofollow noopener">slicer.org</a>.</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Sheldon Scott</p>
