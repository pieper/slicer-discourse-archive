<p>For my project, I need to make linear and closed-curve measurements. I want to mark a point through multiple slices of CT images. I have used the Line Markups tool to make a crosshair at the point, which is visible through the slices, however I am looking for a quicker alternative that will mark just a point. Are there any tools out there that allow for 3D markups, or possibly a point marking tool that is at a fixed position through the slices?</p>
<p>Thank you for the assistance in advance!</p>

<p>You can use markup fiducials and enable projection to see the points an all slices.</p>
