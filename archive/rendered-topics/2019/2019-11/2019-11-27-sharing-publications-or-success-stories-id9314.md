<p>I’ve received a message from a user, sharing the news that his work that utilized 3D Slicer has just been published in a prestigious journal. It would be nice to somehow publicly share these news/success stories. Where could we do that?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.spl.harvard.edu/publications/pages/display/?entriesPerPage=50&amp;collection=1">Slicer publication database</a>, but I don’t know how to upload data there. Also, it would only work for publications, there are no pretty images, and hard to discover new content.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.spl.harvard.edu/publications/gallery?selectedCollection=11">Slicer Image Gallery</a> could work, too, but it has similar issues as the publication database.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Slicer4:VisualBlog">Slicer Visual blog</a> would be suitable but it is essentially dead.</p>
<p>Should we create a new category (maybe subcategory inside Announcements)?</p>
<p>Or we should just use Twitter for this?</p>

<p>There’s also the <a href="https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Main_Page/SlicerCommunity">Slicer Community</a> wiki page with lots of publications going back over 10 years.</p>
<p>It would be great to make this all more discoverable and useful in whatever way possible.</p>
<p>Regarding the publication database it’s maintained by the SPL and it you send an email pubs can be added.</p>

<p>This Slicer Community page seems to be the most up-to-date and easy to update - as long as someone has wiki access.</p>

<p>Yes, it’s pretty well curated so let’s take advantage of that as long as the SPL has resources to keep it up to date.</p>

<p>Hi <a class="mention" href="/u/pieper">@pieper</a>, I’d like to add a few of my papers that cite Slicer and wanted to create an account on Wiki. Couldn’t find the request account / registration there. Would you mind adding me there or adding the information about papers if I send you that? <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>Hi <a class="mention" href="/u/janwitowski">@JanWitowski</a> - it would be great to have your papers added <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/+1.png?v=9" title=":+1:" class="emoji" alt=":+1:"></p>
<p>Probably best to directly contact Marianna (marianna at bwh.harvard.edu) for guidance.  While people can upload their own, sometimes it’s proven easier to manage if it’s done by someone with experience.</p>

<p>Just in case somebody comes across this topic now. The current recommended place to share success stories, is the dedicated <a href="https://discourse.slicer.org/c/community/success-stories/29">Success Stories category</a> of this forum.</p>
