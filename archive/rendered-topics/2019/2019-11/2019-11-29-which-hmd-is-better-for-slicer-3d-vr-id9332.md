<p>Hi<br>
I want to initiate in surgical planning using 3D slicer VR extension, I know that compatible HMD  are HTC vive, Oculus Rift, but there are new versions for these HMD. So there is any consideration that I have to know before buying these new versions?<br>
The new version Oculus Rift S is compatible with 3D Slicer Vr extension, the same question comparing HTC vive vs vive Pro?<br>
Thank you</p>

<p>All the new versions of the headsets are compatible, too. You need to look for PC-based “SteamVR” compatibility.</p>
<p>Even standalone, lower-cost wireless VR headsets are usable (they just provide somewhat lower refresh rate and image quality and of course you still need a desktop that runs Slicer). <a class="mention" href="/u/sunderlandkyl">@Sunderlandkyl</a> has tested this recently.</p>
<p>Note that if you use higher-resolution devices, such as HTC Vive Pro then you need to drive it with much stronger hardware.</p>
