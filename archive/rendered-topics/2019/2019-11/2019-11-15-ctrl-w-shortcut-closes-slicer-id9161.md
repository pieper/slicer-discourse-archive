<p>Operating system: CentOS 7<br>
Slicer version: 4.10.2<br>
Expected behavior: Ctrl + W should clear the scene that I have loaded in Slicer.<br>
Actual behavior: Ctrl + W closes out of Slicer completely, instead of just closing the scene. Thank you!</p>

<p>It should just close the scene. Does this always happen? Have you installed any extensions?</p>

<p>I believe the issue was tied to the “GradQC” extension, and has since been resolved after discussing with the developer. Thank you, Andras.</p>
