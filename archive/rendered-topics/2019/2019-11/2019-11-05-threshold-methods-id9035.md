<p>Hey there!</p>
<p>I am writing my bachelor’s thesis about the topic of segmentation and 3D printing of cerebral arteries (using 3D slicer), what is why i need to know how the different threshold methods are working. I know the Otsu’s method, but i haven’t heard about the rest and there isn’t much information in the documentation.<br>
Where can i get more information? Is there an easier way than viewing the source code?</p>
<p>Thanks for helping!</p>

<p>Slicer uses algorithms implemented in ITK. See detailed description in this paper: <a href="http://hdl.handle.net/10380/3279">http://hdl.handle.net/10380/3279</a></p>
