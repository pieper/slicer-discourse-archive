<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am testing pyradiomic feature repeatability of all seven feature classes(Shape, First-order and 5 Texture features) between different CT images. The phantom i use is a CIRS electron density phantom with 16 solid inserts, therefore, I compare the feature value extracted from insert <span class="hashtag">#1-16</span> of image 1 with the features extracted from corresponding inserts of image 2</p>
<p>I am using an identical method for segmentation ie creating a 13mm radius cylindrical volume 15mm in length(5x3mm slice) for all inserts in my multi-electron density phantom.  The issue i have is no shape feature reaches stability which i have specified at 85% CCC.</p>
<p>I am unsure why shape features are discordant, any help would be greatly appreciated</p>
<p>best wishes,<br>
Michael</p>
