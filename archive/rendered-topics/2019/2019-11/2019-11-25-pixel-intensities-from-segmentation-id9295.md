<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>I am interested in collecting the average pixel intensities from a 2D segmentation of MRI dicom images in slicer.  Is this possible? I have been unable to find this functionality on my initial search- and am posing this question here to see if there is a solution. Thanks.</p>

<p>You can get average (and min, max, stdev) of intensities under each segment using Segment Statistics module.</p>
