<p>Hi everybody,</p>
<p>I have been some problems using Keep largest island tool in  Nightly Version 2019-11-03 and Version 2019-10-28. The main issue is after click in apply bottom, it does not work ( I does not remove unlinked  small segments). At the moment I am using keep selected island as alternative. is this tool under development process?</p>
<p>Regards</p>
