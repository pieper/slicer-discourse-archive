<p>Hi all,<br>
I’m writing to ask if exists a list of supported surgical navigation systems.<br>
I have a commercial navigation platform and I would like to interface it with Slicer…is it possible?</p>
<p>Thanks a lot.<br>
Paolo</p>

<p>3D Slicer can receive real-time tracking information, patient registration transform, etc. from <strong>Medtronic</strong> and <strong>BrainLab</strong> navigation systems.</p>
<p><strong>Stryker</strong> does not have a research interface at all (we reached out to them several times about it), therefore we could not implement connection to Slicer.</p>
