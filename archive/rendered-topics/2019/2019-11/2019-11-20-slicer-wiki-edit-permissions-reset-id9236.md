<p>I tried to edit, and discovered that my permissions to edit Slicer wiki content are gone. Is this expected? Is Slicer wiki in “read only” mode? <a class="mention" href="/u/mhalle">@mhalle</a> do you know what is going on?</p>

<p><a class="mention" href="/u/fedorov">@fedorov</a> What was the exact URL you tried?</p>
<p>I can edit <a href="https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/Nightly/ScriptRepository">https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/Nightly/ScriptRepository</a> page (just tried) and I can see that <a href="https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Special:RecentChanges?hidebots=1&amp;limit=50&amp;days=7&amp;urlversion=2">others have edited Slicer wiki pages successfully</a>, too.</p>

<p>I wanted to add a tutorial link to this page: <a href="https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/Nightly/Modules/PkModeling?veaction=editsource">https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/Nightly/Modules/PkModeling?veaction=editsource</a></p>

<p>I was able to edit <a href="https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/Nightly/ScriptRepository">https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/Nightly/ScriptRepository</a>, but not the page I linked above.</p>
<p>This is very confusing.</p>

<p>I was able to edit the PkModeling page using the link you provided above.</p>

<p>Hopefully <a class="mention" href="/u/freephile">@freephile</a> will be able to explain what is going on.</p>

<p><a class="mention" href="/u/fedorov">@fedorov</a> I can see no reason why you would be prevented from editing that page… except that maybe your session timed out.  You ARE a member of the ‘users’ group and therefore should be able to edit most pages in the wiki.  I reviewed the configuration of permissions and groups in the wiki. I also reviewed the settings (protection) for that particular page.</p>
<p>Can you please try again and let me know the outcome?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Greg</p>

<p>I tried several times again, and it worked. I think what was happening is that somehow wiki was logging me out without indication in the user interface because of some action I did in the interface. I don’t want to spend time debugging this and making a screencast. To cut it short, I was able to update the page. Thank you.</p>

<p>Weird.  The same thing happened to me and I had just logged in one minute earlier.  Then I logged in again and the save worked.</p>
