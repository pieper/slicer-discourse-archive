<p>More specifically I would need for example detailed HAND and WRIST MRI<br>
and maybe FOOT and ANKLE MRI?</p>
<p>I want sources without restrictions, so that I can use it for one presentation and maybe commercial for one osteoporotic product ad… That’s why would like it to be detailed.</p>
<ul>
<li>I have checked VHP they are only in public domain in the U.S., keep in mind that U.S. governmental works are not copyright free in other countries.</li>
<li>I checked  The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) they mostly just have cancer images, not really hand and feet images. Images are mostly very old and not detailed MRI images made with hand coils…</li>
</ul>
<p>So what do you guys suggest?  I spent an unacceptable amount of time searching for HAND WRIST MRI and FOOT MRI and I have not found it…</p>
<p>What do you suggest? I can’t wrap my head around the fact that internet is so huge yet no one ever posted hand wrist with creative commons license…</p>
