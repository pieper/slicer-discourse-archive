<p>Hi there, new to the software and python.<br>
I have the output form model to model distance and be able to view it in color map by ShapePopulationViewer.<br>
I have followed the script from <a href="https://discourse.slicer.org/t/calculating-distance-using-maurer-distance-map/1848/8" class="inline-onebox">Calculating distance using Maurer distance map</a> and be able to get the data of histogram in csv(both raw data of histogram and count of histogram).<br>
I wonder if there is a way I can export the distance data with it’s 3d(x,y,z) coordinates?<br>
Thank you!</p>
