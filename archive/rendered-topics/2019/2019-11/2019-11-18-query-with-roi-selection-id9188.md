<p>Hi…</p>
<p>How can we select the ROI of the same dimension?</p>
<p>When selecting Paint size as 3% , area is selected but these dimensions seem to change for another area/ slice when the image is zoomed.</p>
<p>Is there any way to get fixed-sized ROI for analysis? For example : 2cm diameter circle?</p>
<p>Thank You</p>

<p>In Segment Editor module, you can specify the brush size in percentage of screen size or as absolute size (in mm). Click the <code>%</code> or <code>mm</code> button on the right side of the <code>Diameter</code> row to toggle between them.</p>
