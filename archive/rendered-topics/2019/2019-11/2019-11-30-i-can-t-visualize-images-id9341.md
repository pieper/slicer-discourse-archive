<p>Make sure you have loaded multiple images using Modules list&gt; Volumes&gt; Volume informations&gt; image Dimensions (should be more than 1 on all values),<br>
also make sure the image is centered (1) and the windowing is correct (2) (drag on the image) although this should happen automatically.<br>
If the problem persists try loading the data on another program (microdicom for example) to make sure there is no problem with your data<br>

<p>Viewers may also remain black if you have a very old computer (see <a href="https://discourse.slicer.org/t/black-screen-after-downloading-slicer/1574/13" class="inline-onebox">Black screen after downloading Slicer</a>). What CPU model and graphics card do you have?</p>
