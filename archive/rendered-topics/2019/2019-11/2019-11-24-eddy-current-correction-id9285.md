<p>Hello all, I have input image series: 3DT1w and 3D FLAIR. I want to apply the eddy current correction on both images. Does some Eddy Current correction technique exist in 3D Slicer? I´ve read the GTRACT technique exists in 3D Slicer but can be only used for MR DTI - is that right?</p>
<p>Thanks a lot<br>
