<p>Operating system: windows 10<br>
Slicer version: 4.10.1<br>
Expected behavior: the original image and segmentation are in the same dimension after being exported in ‘.nrrd’ format<br>
Actual behavior: the segmenation is cropped but the original image is not and therefore, the dimension of the exported segmentation became smaller than that of the exported original image</p>
