<p>Hi,<br>
I was wondering if any suggestion on finding publications related to colormap ‘FreeSurferLabels’?</p>
<p>Also I was wondering:</p>
<ol>
<li>what is the algorithm behind the checkbox (and toggle) ‘interpolate’ for displaying image (not the interpolate Resample Scalar Volume)?<br>
2 . And how is the interpolation resolution for the checkbox decided?</li>
</ol>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Hi -</p>
<p>1 - freesurfer labels are from: <a href="https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/" rel="nofollow noopener">https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/</a></p>
<p>2 - interpolation refers to trilinear interpolation when extracting a slice plane from the volume (for labelmaps interpolation leads to artifacts where the labels are mixed before lookup in the table)</p>

<p>Thanks for your reply.<br>
For question <span class="hashtag">#1</span>, I went to the webpage and didn’t find specific explanation of the description for this colormap ‘FreeSurferLabels’ used in slicer.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

</aside>
<p>Can you provide more details about what you were looking for?  The color table itself is just a mapping from numbers to colors - it only really makes sense if the numbers were generated by FreeSurfer.</p>

<p>I am looking for the rational behind the number to color mapping.<br>
I just found it this colormap worked well for my MRI images (not generated by free surfer).<br>
Thus, I need some understanding and also justification of using this color map.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Maybe you can get some insight by reviewing <a href="https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/FreeSurferMethodsCitation" rel="nofollow noopener">the material and citations from the FreeSurfer wiki</a>.  The specific numbers and colors are an essentially arbitrary standard - maybe chosen to be easy to see by someone (maybe a neuroscientist who studied human vision?) who spent time picking, but as far as I know nothing more than that.</p>
