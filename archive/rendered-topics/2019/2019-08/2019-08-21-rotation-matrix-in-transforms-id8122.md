<p>Hi All</p>
<p>Sorry about all this amateur questions and new post. But could someone explain me how to get the displacement of one segment to another in terms of rotations please. I did segment registration and got a the linear transform, but I don’t know how to calculate Euler s angles of rotation of my segment out of this numbers. Thanks a lot</p>
