<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I would like to ask if there is a way I can reduce my current segmentation by 1 mm from all the sides? ( it doesn’t have to be exactly 1 mm could be 2 or 3) however something that I can reduce from all the sides of the segmentation by specific amount? Also increase by certain distance from all sides too.</p>

<p>Hi:</p>
<p>You can use the Margin effect in the Segment Editor to grow or shrink the segmentation</p>
