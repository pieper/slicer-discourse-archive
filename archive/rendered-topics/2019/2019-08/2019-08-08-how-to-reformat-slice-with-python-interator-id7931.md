<p>Hi Dears 3DSlicer developers and users</p>
<p>I have 3D CT volume images.I want to change slice properties such as its center and orientation. For example I want to get slice with the center in the certain location (r0, a0, s0) and rotation around the S axis by certain angle.<br>
I know to use Reformat module, but I want to use Python interactor to do it.<br>
Please guide me by examples or tutorials in Python.<br>
