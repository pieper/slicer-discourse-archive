<p>Thanks for the clarification.</p>
<p>I have succeeded in installing the extensions using yesterday’s preview release version. But I still have two other questions.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I want to export deformable transform, but when I install “SlicerRT” extension, “DICOM Registration Export” module didn’t show up. I have followed this <a href="https://discourse.slicer.org/t/import-of-registration-dicom-files/368/22">thread</a> but don’t know how to use that? Could you give some advice?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I was a bit confused about the warning(?) in Python Interactor (shown below). I have installed “SlicerRT” extension and also succeeded in importing RT structure, but the warning(?) still existed? Does it make any difference?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Thank you!</p>
