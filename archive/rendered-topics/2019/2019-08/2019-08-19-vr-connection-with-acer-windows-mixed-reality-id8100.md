<p>Hello.</p>
<p>I have bought a Acer WMR headset and I followed the instructions to use it with Slicer extension. It was working very fine in the last days. But today my headset does not leave a " sleep mode". When I try to use it at Slicer extension the headset remains black. Does anyone had that problem before?</p>

<p>My first obvious question is whether you tried restarting the computer. Maybe try plugging it in a different USB slot.</p>
<p>My second obvious question is whether your cable is intact. I’m talking out of experience, my cat chewed through 3 cables…</p>
