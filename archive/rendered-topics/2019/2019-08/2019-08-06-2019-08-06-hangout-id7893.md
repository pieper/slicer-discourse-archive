<p>Here is a notebook I created a while back that is using REST API to collect data from CDash. See <a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jcfr/jupyter-notebooks/blob/master/01_Collect_Slicer_Dashboard_Stats.ipynb">https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jcfr/jupyter-notebooks/blob/master/01_Collect_Slicer_Dashboard_Stats.ipynb</a></p>

<p>This is great, thanks!</p>
<p>I am thinking about creating a page that displays something similar to the table in the notebook, auto-generated each day after the builds are (hopefully) finished. I will probably do something quick/lazy with github pages to get it up and running.</p>

<p>Makes sense.</p>
<p>Some history: When we used to automatically update the wiki after the build are completed, we were running <a href="https://github.com/Slicer/slicer-wiki-scripts#slicer_wiki_extension_module_listingpy">this script</a> on each factory, and then we were consolidating all gathered information later that day. This was not very robust.</p>
<p>A simple approach could be to setup a recurrent travis cronjob, that would generate the tables for the current day and previous day every hours. I can point you to an example of such job that is already publishing github pages (this is what we do for the apidocs)</p>
