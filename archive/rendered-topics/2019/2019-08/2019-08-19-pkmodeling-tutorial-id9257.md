<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>Fairly new to DCE-analysis and thought this thread was on topic to a question I had:</p>
<ul>
<li>What did you find was the best method to analyze your output PK maps once generated in Slicer? (I.e. Exporting data format and subsequent image analysis software)</li>
</ul>
<p>I have tried using DICOM and MATLAB respectively as stated in a previous thread: <a href="https://discourse.slicer.org/t/dicom-export-rounding-to-integer-values/8038/6" class="inline-onebox">DICOM Export Rounding to Integer Values</a>. Here, I was recommended to use Python, Matlab Bridge extension or MATLAB with <a href="https://github.com/PerkLab/SlicerMatlabBridge/blob/master/MatlabCommander/commandserver/nrrdread.m" rel="nofollow noopener">nrrdread.m</a> instead. I have been investigating these options but thought I’d come to the experts here with previous experience in exporting data for PK mapping specifically.</p>
<p>I also couldn’t find any direct PKModeling tutorials available online, so I made my own for my research group. I could make this publicly available if it was thought worthwhile? Just wanting to figure out the best export method first.</p>

<p>Madeleine, we always welcome users to share the tutorials they developed! You can share the link to the tutorial you created, and I can link it from the PkModeling documentation pages. Any form is fine - PDF, YouTube, Google Slides, PPT, web page, … - whatever you already have, and what you found to be helpful for your group.</p>

<p>Hi Andrey,</p>
<p>This is the tutorial I created for my research group. I hope it is helpful to others! Note I sub-linked a tutorial originally made by you that I found to really help also: <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BL-cCULz6EtTSH9rNolOxLFRUMgS5Vjh/view?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow noopener">PKModeling Tutorial</a></p>
<p>Best,<br>

<p><a class="mention" href="/u/madeline">@madeline</a> sorry for the delay,  but I finally updated the PkModeling wiki page to link your tutorial. It is now linked from here: <a href="https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/Nightly/Modules/PkModeling">https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/Nightly/Modules/PkModeling</a></p>
<p>Thank you for your contribution!</p>
