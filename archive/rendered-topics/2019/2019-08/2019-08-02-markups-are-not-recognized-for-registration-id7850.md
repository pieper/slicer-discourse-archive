<p>Hello Slicer support,</p>
<p>For some reason on my desktop computer, there is a problem with recognizing the markups for registration. I tried using both Slicer 4.10.1 and 4.10.2 (the stable versions). This issue has never happened to me before.</p>
<p>Popup message: “Markups must be places first before registration of scans can occur.”</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>
<p>Operating system:<br>
Slicer version:<br>
Expected behavior:<br>
Actual behavior:</p>
