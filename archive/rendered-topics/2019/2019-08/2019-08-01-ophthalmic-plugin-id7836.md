<p>Hi, is there any plugin for ophthalmic application ?<br>
like reading ophthalmic oct and fundus images (dicom etc …) and displaying them according to the ophthalmic convention ?<br>
if not I aw willing to help on that but don’t have time to do it on my own.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

<p>It sounds like an excellent application but I’m not aware of anyone actively developing a user-focused extension for that right now.  If you search for slicer OCT you’ll find some general experiments and proof of concept work.</p>
