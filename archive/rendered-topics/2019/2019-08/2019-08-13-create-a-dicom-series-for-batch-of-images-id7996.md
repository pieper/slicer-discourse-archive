<p>I am able to convert a nrrd file to a DICOM series manually using the Create a DICOM Series module, however, I can’t find a way to conduct this process automatically and I have 200 image sets that each need to be converted. Is there any way to do this DICOM creation in batch?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>You can find all the parameters that were passed to the DICOM series creator CLI module and you can run the same module from the command-line using similar parameters.</p>
