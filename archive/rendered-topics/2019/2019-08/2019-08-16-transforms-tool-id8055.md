<p>Hi! I am new to Slicer. I am trying to use <strong>transforms</strong> <strong>tool</strong> to orient and fix my segmentation in **3D viewer **, I need help for any document or tutorial or if someone can explain procedure will be appreciated. I didn’t find any tutorial on YouTube.</p>
<p>I have an example of image from another article, but I don’t think so if it’s possible to show images from a published article without authorization. Thanks!</p>

<p>By modifying transforms, you fix <em>registration</em> results. You can fix <em>segmentation</em> using Segment Editor module. So, it is not clear which tool you would like to use. Could you describe what you would like to achieve?</p>

<p>This is a quick tutorial showing how to reset the 3D view and how to use Transform module, you need to create a transform, chose the segmentation to transform(arrow), edit transform settings, then harden (apply) the transform <a href="https://youtu.be/Ylr7gdMcXGo" rel="nofollow noopener">https://youtu.be/Ylr7gdMcXGo</a></p>
