<p>Dear Authors/Contributors,</p>
<p>I would be interested in using the Tractography ROI Seeding module provided as extension in Slicer (4.8.1). I started by reading the documentation (<a href="https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/Nightly/Modules/TractographyLabelMapSeeding" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/Nightly/Modules/TractographyLabelMapSeeding</a>), however I haven’t found any reference paper for a detailed description of the algorithm implemented in this module. Would you be so kind to provide me with this necessary information?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>Best regards,<br>
Simone</p>

<p>Hi Simone.<br>
It is second-order Runge-Kutta integration, also called the midpoint method.<br>
Additional related documentation can be found here:<br>
