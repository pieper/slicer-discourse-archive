<p>my goal is to extract the curve that forms the upper jaw. For this I used extract skeleton tool and I have obtained a set of points. Now I would like to do a Belzier curve from these points. somebody could help me?</p>

<p>You can use “Markups to model” extension to create curves from markup fiducial points.</p>
