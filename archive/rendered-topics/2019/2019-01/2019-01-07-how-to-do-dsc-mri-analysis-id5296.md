<p>I do not know how to use DSC MRI ANALYSIS. There is a tutorial for that extension? Also, there is a database of images which  I could use for practice?</p>

<p>I think the lead developers of that module moved on long time ago. I do not think it is supported. I think it would be appropriate to remove that module from Slicer to avoid any confusion.</p>
