<p>We’ll have a breakout session where we will share with each other how machine learning is implemented by various groups. We will then discuss how our efforts can be coordinated and see how we can create shared infrastructure for common tasks.</p>
<p>Anybody who is interested in using machine learning for medical image computing is welcome.</p>
<p>See more information and sign up <a href="https://na-mic.github.io/ProjectWeek/PW30_2019_GranCanaria/BreakoutSessions/MachineLearning.html" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a>.</p>
