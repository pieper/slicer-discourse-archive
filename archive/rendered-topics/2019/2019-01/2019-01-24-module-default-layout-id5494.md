<p>Hello,</p>
<p>When building a module, is there any way to remove or reduce the size of the icon and “3DSlicer” title frame on top?</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>
Giang</p>

<p>Sure, you could use findChildren and hide the logo.</p>
<p>There’s been some debate about that logo over the years because it does take up space, but there’s also the need for Slicer to have a recognizable identity.  If you do hide the logo it would be nice (but not required) for you to compensate by citing or promoting Slicer in other ways.</p>
