<p>Two people asked me in the past couple of days about how to place job postings and Andriy has also just posted one. So, we have enough of these that we should define a standard way of dealing with these.</p>
<p>I think we should create a new category. What should be the name? Jobs, Job board, Marketplace, Job opportunities, …?</p>
<p>Should we subscribe new users to this new category by default?</p>

<p>I think category called Jobs would be good, but no, I don’t think new users should be subscribed by default.</p>

<p>Yes, I agree, a separate category is better, since otherwise those posts do not match the existing category description, which can be annoying for those interested in Slicer-specific announcements. I posted into that category with a tag just following the earlier precedent.</p>

<p>FWIW “Jobs” or “Jobs board” will be consistent with how MICCAI advertises those: <a href="https://www.miccai.org/jobs" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.miccai.org/jobs</a></p>

<p>I’ve created a new category - <a href="https://discourse.slicer.org/c/announcements/jobs">Jobs</a> - and moved all existing job postings there.</p>
