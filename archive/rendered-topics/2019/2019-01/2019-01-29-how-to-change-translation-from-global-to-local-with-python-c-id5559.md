<p>I can create a transform and set translation on local manually. But are there any code could change translation from global to Local with python code?<br>
I checked github code found: <code>setCoordinateReference(LOCAL)</code>, while a error happen as follows:<br>
‘vTransformr.setCoordinateReference(LOCAL)<br>
Traceback (most recent call last):<br>
File “”, line 1, in <br>
AttributeError: ‘vtkCommonTransformsPython.vtkTransform’ object has no attribute 'setCoordinateReference’</p>
