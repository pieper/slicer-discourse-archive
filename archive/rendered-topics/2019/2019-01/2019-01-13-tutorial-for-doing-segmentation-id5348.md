<p>Hello everybody,</p>
<p>I am working on creating annotated segmentation data for a project and a colleague recommended me to use 3D Slicer for the task.</p>
<p>I have installed 3D Slicer as well as its SlicerRT extension and have successfully loaded and visualized the segmentation for a data sample, which consists of multiple CT files and a RTSTRUCT.dcm file. Now I have to manually annotate other samples that I am given, and then export to corresponding RTSTRUCT.dcm files.</p>
<p>Could you please give me some advice on how I can get started with 3D Slicer for this task? Any references to tutorials/slides/videos are very much appreciated!</p>
<p>Thank you very much in advance for your help!</p>

<p>I would like to learn more about using Slicer to do 3D segmentation. Could you guys please point me to more references?</p>
<p>On the <a href="https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/4.8/Training#Segmentation" rel="nofollow noopener">official page</a> there are two tutorials listed:</p>
<ol>
<li>Segmentation for 3D printing: shows how to use the Segment Editor module for combining CAD designed parts with patient-specific models.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/4.8/Training#Segmentation_for_3D_printing" rel="nofollow noopener">Segmentation for 3D printing Step-by-step tutorial<br>
</a></strong></li>
<li>Author: Csaba Pinter, MSc</li>
<li>Audience: Users and developers interested in segmentation and 3D printing</li>
<li>Based on: 3D Slicer version 4.7</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<strong><a href="https://youtu.be/BJoIexIvtGo" rel="nofollow noopener">Video tutorial: Whole heart segmentation from cardiac CT</a></strong>  shows how to use the Segment Editor module for segmenting heart ventricles, atria, and great vessels from cardiac CT volumes.</li>

<li>Audience: Users who need to segment heart structures, for example for visualization, quantification, or simulation.</li>
<li>Sample data set</li>
<li>Based on: 3D Slicer version 4.8</li>
</ul>
<p>Unfortunately I don’t feel that they are enough for me <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/frowning.png?v=6" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"></p>
<p>I have found some additional tutorials on Google, e.g. [see my replies be low because I’m a new user so I cannot put more then 3 links] but they are for Slicer 3 <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/frowning.png?v=6" title=":frowning:" class="emoji" alt=":frowning:"> Could anybody with experience have a quick look and tell me if they are still relevant for Slicer 4?</p>
<p>Thank you so much in advance for your help!</p>

<p>There are 3 step-by-step tutorials and several segmentation recipes on the <a href="https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/Nightly/Training#Segmentation" rel="nofollow noopener">training page of the latest Slicer version</a>.</p>
<p>You can also find lots of questions and answers about segmentation on this forum (see <a href="https://discourse.slicer.org/tags/segmentation">segmentation tag</a> or use the search function).</p>
<p>You may get help at any of the <a href="https://discourse.slicer.org/c/community/hangout">Slicer weekly hangouts</a> or if you attend a <a href="https://na-mic.github.io/ProjectWeek/" rel="nofollow noopener">Slicer project week</a>.</p>
<p>If any of your questions are not answered, feel free to post it as a new topic in this forum.</p>
