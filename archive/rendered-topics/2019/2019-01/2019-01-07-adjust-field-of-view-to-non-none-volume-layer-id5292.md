<p>Could anyone explain what does non-None volume layer mean?<br>
I was exporting screenshots and found this button above the view window, “Adjust the slice viewer’s field of view to match the extent of non-None volume layer (bg, then fg, then label)”. Does it mean adjust the view to the middle of images?</p>

<p>Yes, clicking that rectangle button centers the slice view on the image volume.</p>

<p>The ‘non-None’ language means that if you have a background layer it will fit that, or if there’s no background selected it will pick foreground, etc.</p>
