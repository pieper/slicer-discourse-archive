<p>Hi… I want to perform registration of longitudinal scans of a patient with a brain tumour.  These scans at later time points are distorted due to a tumour/surgery/growth. Baseline will be preoperative scan.  Which will be the most suitable module? Could someone post a link of details/ recommended settings?<br>
Thanks in advance.</p>
<p>Operating system: Mac<br>
Slicer version: 4.10<br>
Expected behavior:<br>
Actual behavior:</p>
