<p>I am working on 3D data and 4D data  Virtual reality. I am able to render both models but there are some issues I would like to resolve;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Is it possible to link the 3D and 4D data sets (so that they can be moved at the same time). I did a transform to attach the two data sets but in virtual space when I try to move combined data set (3D and 4D ) it is not locked and both data set move separately.</p>

<p>Secondly is it possible to fix the position in VR space so that when we open the scene in VR that it has the same position every time?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, is it possible to change controller functionality in VR space?</p>
