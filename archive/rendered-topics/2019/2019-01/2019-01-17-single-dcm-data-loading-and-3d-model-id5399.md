<p>Operating system: Windows 10<br>
Slicer version: 4.10.1<br>
Expected behavior: Create an accurate 3D model from a serie of single .dcm files from MRI<br>
Actual behavior: can’t load the files in the DCM folder (displays 0 patients added), if I load the .dcm files from the “data folder” it shows each single slice and can’t create an accurate 3D model of the patient.</p>
<p>I’m reading all the chats about this topic and followin tutorials but can’t fix it. I was able to make a proper work using the “sample files” from Slicer but can’t do it anymore with my own dcm images.<br>
Could you help me? Thank you so much!<br>
G.</p>
