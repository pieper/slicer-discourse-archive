<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Is there any way to toggle visibility of the controller bars for Plot/Table or even the main View through Python? I can access that bar for the slice view through sliceController() call but it seems the other Views don’t have similar capabilities. Thanks a lot!</p>

<p>The name is always the same as the view type (threeD, slice, plot, table). See example in the script repository: <a href="https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/Nightly/ScriptRepository#Hide_view_controller_bars" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/Nightly/ScriptRepository#Hide_view_controller_bars</a></p>
