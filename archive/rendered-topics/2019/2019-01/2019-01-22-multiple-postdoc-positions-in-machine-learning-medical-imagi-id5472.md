<p>Hello,</p>
<p>The Quantitative Translational Imaging Lab at the Martinos Center (QTIM) is hiring multiple postdoctoral fellows in the next few months. We are particularly interested in applicants with experience in ophthalmology, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) acquisition, and post-acquisition image analysis in radiology.</p>
<p>If you are interested in applying, please see the full job postings on our website: <a href="https://qtim-lab.github.io/jobs/" rel="nofollow noopener">https://qtim-lab.github.io/jobs/</a>. Do not hesitate to send any questions regarding these positions or our research to <a href="mailto:kalpathy@nmr.mgh.harvard.edu">kalpathy@nmr.mgh.harvard.edu</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Lab Description</strong><br>
We are QTIM (<a href="https://qtim-lab.github.io/" rel="nofollow noopener">https://qtim-lab.github.io</a>)— the Quantitative Translational Imaging in Medicine Lab at the Athinoula A. Martinos Center of the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). We are affiliated with the Health Sciences and Technology Program at MIT and Harvard Medical School. We are computer scientists, medical physicists, neuro-oncologists, MRI technicians, and clinical research coordinators. We focus broadly on quantitative and machine learning techniques in medical imaging, with a growing interest in deep learning. We try to bridge the gap between machine learning research and clinical practice through fruitful connections with our clinical collaborators in and out of the MGH ecosystem.</p>
<p>We are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity. We also know that the work of diversity and anti-discrimination extends past choices in hiring. We work every single day to make our lab an equitable and productive space for everyone, regardless of their race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status.</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br>
Andrew Beers</p>
