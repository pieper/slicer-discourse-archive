<p>Hi everyone,<br>
I am experiencing some issue when trying to access slicer training modules. I am running into security issues to access that saying connection is not private and does not use https. I tried chrome and microsoft edge and also disabled antivirus but still not working. Attached is the screenshot.<br>
This is something new and was not there last month. Would someone pls help.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>

<p>Hmm, this link worked for me:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/9jfsyhhgude5hf1/Slicer4.8minute_SoniaPujol.pdf?dl=0%7C" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.dropbox.com/s/9jfsyhhgude5hf1/Slicer4.8minute_SoniaPujol.pdf?dl=0%7C</a></p>

<p>It worked for me, too.</p>
<p>Note that what you see is not an error, the link works, you just get a security warning because for some reason the top-level security certificate is not trusted. You can click on Details and proceed to the page anyway.</p>
