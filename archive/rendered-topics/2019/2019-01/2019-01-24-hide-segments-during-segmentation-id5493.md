<p>Hi!</p>
<p>I am working on T1 weighted images of lower leg muscles and I am manually doing the segmentation where each muscle I am interested in corresponds to a segment.</p>
<p>I opened the saved file .mrml  but when I want to hide a segment by closing the little eye, it does not disappear. Moreover, it is not possible to delete errors in the drawing in order to improve the precision of the segmentation. <div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://us1.discourse-cdn.com/flex002/uploads/slicer/original/3X/c/5/c5d6b24f8b00d193ebea38709c866b9c1bcdd70f.png" data-download-href="/uploads/short-url/sea2U97k1NPlcXBJROn1Bp0A6D5.png?dl=1" title="1" rel="noopener nofollow ugc"><img src="https://us1.discourse-cdn.com/flex002/uploads/slicer/optimized/3X/c/5/c5d6b24f8b00d193ebea38709c866b9c1bcdd70f_2_690x369.png" alt="1" data-base62-sha1="sea2U97k1NPlcXBJROn1Bp0A6D5" width="690" height="369" srcset="https://us1.discourse-cdn.com/flex002/uploads/slicer/optimized/3X/c/5/c5d6b24f8b00d193ebea38709c866b9c1bcdd70f_2_690x369.png, https://us1.discourse-cdn.com/flex002/uploads/slicer/optimized/3X/c/5/c5d6b24f8b00d193ebea38709c866b9c1bcdd70f_2_1035x553.png 1.5x, https://us1.discourse-cdn.com/flex002/uploads/slicer/original/3X/c/5/c5d6b24f8b00d193ebea38709c866b9c1bcdd70f.png 2x" data-dominant-color="B79690"><div class="meta"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use href="#far-image"></use></svg><span class="filename">1</span><span class="informations">1366×731 147 KB</span><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use href="#discourse-expand"></use></svg></div></a></div> I tried to restart 3DSlicer but nothing happens.</p>
<p>I attached two screenshots so the problem may be better understandable.<br>
How can I fix this problem?</p>
<p>Thanks for your help,</p>
<p>Antea</p>

<p>Probably you have multiple segmentations. You can see all the segments in all segmentations at the same time if you go to Data module.</p>
