<p>Hi,<br>
Are there any tutorials on how to download the simulated ultrasound data from the Slicer application? Or does anybody know of the steps to download multiple scans from different transducer positions without taking a screenshot of each simulated image?</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

<p>You can use Sequences module to record real or simulated ultrasound sequences. See <a href="http://www.slicerigt.org/wp/user-tutorial/" rel="nofollow noopener">SlicerIGT tutorials</a> for details. If after going through the tutorials you still have questions then let us know.</p>
