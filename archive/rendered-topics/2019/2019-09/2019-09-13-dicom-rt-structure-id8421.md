<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I hope you are very well,</p>
<p>I would like to ask if there is a way I can use dicom volume and corresponding dicom RT structure loaded into 3d slicer to extract radiomic features using SlicerRadiomics extension? or do I have to convert dicom RT structure into nrrd to use SlicerRadiomics?</p>
<p>Thank you very much in advance.</p>
<p>best<br>
Tenzin</p>

<p>If you use Slicer’s graphical user interface for loading and analyzing your data then it does not matter what file format (DICOM, nrrd, nifti, …) you read your data from.</p>
