<p>Hi all:</p>
<p>The DICOM issue appears to be fixed!! (see <a href="https://discourse.slicer.org/t/update-on-build-factory-status/8146" class="inline-onebox">Update on Build factory status</a>)</p>
<p>Installers / extensions will be available today, but late due to an issue with the Extension Index (see <a href="https://github.com/Slicer/ExtensionsIndex/commit/e78e514128f3c34792380fe1f1da9fc80842febd" rel="nofollow noopener">https://github.com/Slicer/ExtensionsIndex/commit/e78e514128f3c34792380fe1f1da9fc80842febd</a> - will look into creating a fix/check for this)</p>
<p>Additional notes:<br>
Due to issues with the Midas 3 instance, packages will sometimes appear to not have uploaded on CDash reports (See end of error log here: <a href="http://slicer.cdash.org/viewBuildError.php?buildid=1691369" rel="nofollow noopener">http://slicer.cdash.org/viewBuildError.php?buildid=1691369</a>) However, packages are uploading and are available from the download page / extension manager.</p>
