<p>Hi, here is a simple AutoHotKey script to use speed scrolling on a regular mouse wheel if the lateral buttons are pressed before scrolling and then stop when a regular scroll is registred,<br>
i found this feature quite interesting to quickly go through a volume without reaching for the slice slider, also in some cases the slider doesn’t provide a scroll as smooth as with the wheel input.<br>
Ps : Also useful for code scrolling<br>

(Please correct me if it’s the wrong category, i was not sure where to post this)</p>

<p>Thank you for sharing, this could be useful.</p>
<p>Another option to browse slices is by holding down the shift key while moving the mouse in an orthogonal view. It is easier to position the moues in a viewer then grabbing the slider and you can make the motion faster/more sensitive by zooming in/out the view.</p>
