<p>Hello, a segmentation I created is vanishing from the 3D view after hardening a transformation to it. Before hardening, it shows up transformed as expected. I am using version 4.11.0-2019-09-01 r28473.</p>

<p>We cannot reproduce this. Could you describe what you did exactly?</p>

<p>I abandoned that code, sorry for this now useless post since I can’t reproduce anymore.</p>
