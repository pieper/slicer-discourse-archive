<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I already read questions about this problem, but for me nothing worked.<br>
I used to use 3D slicer with DICOM files without problem. After 2 or 3 months without using it, yesterday I tried and it doesn’t work (for the same DICOM files…).</p>
<p>I updated the Slicer version (it is now 4.10.2) and I am working with LINUX (CentOS Linux 7).</p>
<p>I try to import DICOM series and I receive the same error I saw for lots of people:<br>
“Slicer has caught an internal error.<br>
You may be able to continue from this point, but results are undefined.<br>
Suggested action is to save your work and restart.<br>
If you have a repeatable sequence of steps that causes this message, please report the issue following instructions available at <a href="http://slicer.org" rel="nofollow noopener">http://slicer.org</a><br>
The message detail is:<br>
Exception thrown in event: Calling methods on uninitialized ctkDICOMItem”</p>
<ul>
<li>I changed directory (with a shorter one) and same error;</li>
<li>I used DICOM patcher and another error:<br>
" DICOM patching started…<br>
Unexpected error: ‘module’ object has no attribute ‘UID’"</li>
</ul>
<p>I am using original clinical DICOM files, I didn’t change anything, it works with other softwares and I already opened them with Slicer before without problems…</p>
<p>Can someone help me please?</p>
<p>Thank you in advance!!</p>
