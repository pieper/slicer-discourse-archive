<p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>I have a similar question<br>
I have created one extension in Slicer and a second one using Matlab Bridge. How is the procedure to call the Matlab Bridge extension in my python code?</p>
<p>thanks a lot</p>
<p>Best</p>

<p>You can call Matlab modules the same way as any other CLI modules, as described <a href="https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/Nightly/Developers/Python_scripting#Running_a_CLI_from_Python" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a>.</p>
