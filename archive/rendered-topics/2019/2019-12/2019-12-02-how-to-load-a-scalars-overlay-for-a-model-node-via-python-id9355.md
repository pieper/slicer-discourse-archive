<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I want to overlay some .mgh file on model (lh.pial),<br>
the model can be loaded by:<br>
model = slicer.util.loadModel(‘lh.pial’)<br>
but it did not work by:<br>
scalar = slicer.util.loadScalarOverlay(‘surf.mgh’)<br>
Is there a function to overlay the .mgh on model?</p>
<p>Thanks so much.</p>
