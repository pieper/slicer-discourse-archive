<p>Hey, I am Shahid Khan and I have just started using 3-D slicer(a week ago) for my project.<br>
I am working on lung tumor. I have extracted DICOM CT data of lung cancer from TCIA. I need porosity(Ve) and permeability(Ktrans) maps of the tumor to import in OpenFOAM for further analysis.<br>
Can anyone please help me in generating these maps using any model or in any other way? Thanks in advance.</p>
