<p>Operating system: Windows 10<br>
Slicer version: 4.7.0<br>
Expected behavior: Open Annotations panel when I select Annotations module<br>
Actual behavior: When I try to open annotations module panel, it doesn’t actually do anything. I want to hide or eliminate ruler measurements, but I can’t do it without annotations module. It has not happened with other modules.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

<p>Hi -</p>
<p>At a baseline you can upgrade to the latest release (4.10.2) or the nightly preview build since a lot of improvements have been made.</p>
<p>Not sure why the Annotation module isn’t showing up in 4.7, but you could look in the error log window for any hints.</p>
