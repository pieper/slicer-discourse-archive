<p>Operating system: Windows 10 Intel core I7<br>
Slicer version: 4.8.1<br>
Expected behavior:<br>
Actual behavior:<br>
I am using slicer 3D 4.8.1 version for modelling. However I am facing issue of hanging for every single event.  Even if I undo or create a new segment, the slicer software hangs and taking longer time to respond. Could you help us to assit this issue. My file is not big and it is range of few 100kb.</p>
