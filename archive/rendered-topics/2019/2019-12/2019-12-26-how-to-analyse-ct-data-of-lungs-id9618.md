<p>Hey, I am Shahid Khan and I am very new to 3-d slicer(started a week ago). I want to analyze CT data of lung cancer and want to generate Ktrans and Ve maps. I have data in Scalar volume but to use T1 mapping I need it in Multivolume mode? I am not able to understand this. Can anyone help me with this?</p>
