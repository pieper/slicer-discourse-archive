<p>I am having problem opening MVL file. May i know if RawImageGuess is available to install in a separate file? i was not able to locate it:(</p>

<p>Inatalling RawImageGuess extension will not make mvl files load automatically. There are a couple of manual steps, see example <a href="https://youtu.be/ajpOQEAyWkA">here</a>:</p>
<div class="youtube-onebox lazy-video-container" data-video-id="ajpOQEAyWkA" data-video-title="How to load a file of unknown format into 3D Slicer" data-video-start-time="" data-provider-name="youtube">
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajpOQEAyWkA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
    <img class="youtube-thumbnail" src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/ajpOQEAyWkA/maxresdefault.jpg" title="How to load a file of unknown format into 3D Slicer" width="" height="">
  </a>
</div>

<p>If someone is interested in making loading fully automatic then it should be doable, but it may require a couple of weeks of development work.</p>
