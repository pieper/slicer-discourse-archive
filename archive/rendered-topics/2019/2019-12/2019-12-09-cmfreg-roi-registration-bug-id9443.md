<p>There is a bug with CMF reg ROI registration method. I found this in the stable version as well as the nightly build.  This is from the nightly build.</p>
<p>Landmarks ROI does change dynamically and is kept at a fixed value. Can some one please tell me how to fix this ? ROI is stuck at 10.</p>
<p>I did get rid of the all the configurations files and started with fresh install. (i am using Linux)</p>
