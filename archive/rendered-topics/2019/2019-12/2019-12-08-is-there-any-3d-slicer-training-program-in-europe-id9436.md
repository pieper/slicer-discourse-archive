<p>Hi,<br>
We will have the project week in the Canary Islands Jan 20-24. If you are university affiliate, you might be able to get travel support through the Erasmus program.<br>

Best<br>

<p>You may also organize a training course at your institution, tailored to interests and needs of your group. The minimum is about 15 participants and it may be possible get the training for free (you just need to cover travel expenses).</p>
