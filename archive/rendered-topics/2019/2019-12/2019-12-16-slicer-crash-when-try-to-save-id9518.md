<p>The only known reason why Slicer would crash is due to running out of memory. To make sure Slicer has enough memory, close other applications that consume a lot of memory or increase available memory space (install more physical RAM, make sure you have at least a few 10GB of free disk space, or increase virtual memory size in your system settings). You may also try using latest nightly version of Slicer, which has memory usage improvements and many other fixes.</p>
