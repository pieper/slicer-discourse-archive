<p>Hello gentlemen,</p>
<p>This topic has been found in an old post but I did not find a solution, and therefore come back to you to ask if there is a known way through this problem.</p>
<p>Thank you for your great work.</p>
<p>I look forward for a further use of ‘Slicer’ as I need it in my daily work; I create anatomical illustration for veterinary (dog) and human professionals</p>

<p>Do you use the legacy Editor module?</p>
<p>Use Segment Editor module in latest stable version of Slicer (currently 4.10.1) and there should be no such issues. See tutorials here: <a href="https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/Nightly/Training#Segmentation" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/Nightly/Training#Segmentation</a></p>
