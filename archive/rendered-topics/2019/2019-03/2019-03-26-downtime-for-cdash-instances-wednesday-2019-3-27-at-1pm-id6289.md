<p>Hi Folks,</p>
<p>You should expect downtime associated with <a href="http://slicer.cdash.org/">http://slicer.cdash.org/</a> tomorrow.</p>
<p>CDash instances will be offline Wednesday, 3/7 at 1pm for roughly 1 hour while the associated database server is upgraded. External visitors will see a maintenance page during the outage.</p>
