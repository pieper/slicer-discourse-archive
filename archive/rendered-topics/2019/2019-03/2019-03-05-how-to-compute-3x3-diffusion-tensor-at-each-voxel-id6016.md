Hi guys</p>
<p>I am trying to extract 3x3 diffusion tensor at each voxel of the image. It seems we can see trace, max-min eigenvalues etc but not the tensor itself. I also dont know how to export the this data (say in *.txt) so that I can use for further analysis. I am so tired of spending hours with Slicer. I will greatly appreciate any kind of help. Thanks.</p>

<p>Did you see the tutorials at <a href="http://dmri.slicer.org/docs/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://dmri.slicer.org/docs/</a>, and specifically “Slicer DTI tutorial”?</p>

<p>Thanks Andrey.</p>
<p>Also please see information towards the bottom of the page here <a href="http://dmri.slicer.org/docs/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://dmri.slicer.org/docs/</a> about how to access tensors from Python, in case that is what you are looking for. It’s not clear from your message what your goal is.</p>
