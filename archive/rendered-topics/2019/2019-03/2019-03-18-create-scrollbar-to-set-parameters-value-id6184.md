<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I would like to create a scrollbar or similar to set a parameter value with the use of python code.<br>
I have created some interactive buttons to get paths and volumes in my module but I don’t know how to reach this new issue.</p>
<p>Moreover, I would like to display changes in the scene as parameter changes value.</p>
<p>The idea is similar to opacity scrollbar.</p>
<p>Any help is kindly appreciated!</p>
