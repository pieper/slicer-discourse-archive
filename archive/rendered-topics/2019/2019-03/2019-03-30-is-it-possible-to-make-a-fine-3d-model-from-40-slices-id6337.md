<p>Hi! I have simple question. We have a bunch of series of MRI of a baby, but all of the series contain 40 slices tops. Is it possible to make a fine 3D model having that amount of slices or it’s just a waste of time? (the volume of a baby)</p>

<p>I think it will depend on how big the baby is, and how fine the model needs to be. What is the end goal - to make a pretty picture, or to do some measurements/assessment/planning of an intervention?</p>

<p>Thank you for the answer. The goal is to do some planning of intervention. The maximum size of the baby is about 20-22 cm (longitudinal). I mean the multiplanar reconstruction is simply terrible because of the small amount of slices.</p>
