<p>Goodmorning,</p>
<p>Following the tutorials on segùentation, I watched the second video (01) o, the otsu masking method and do not find it within the available modules(I use slicer 4.10.1).</p>
<p>Is it an addon?</p>

<p>I’m not sure which tutorial you are referring to. Can you post the link to the page where you have found it and the exact name of the tutorial (or text of the download link)?</p>
