<p>Hi!<br>
I’m trying to understand the values in the preset file used in Volume Rendering.<br>
The preset file is found by searching “preset” in …Program Files/slicer…</p>
<p>For instance, why is there 5 values in gradientOpacity, and what are the different values?<br>
Is there a transferfunction or shader that explains these settings?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>See specification of .vp file <a href="https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/Nightly/Modules/VolumeRendering#Format_of_Volume_Property_.28.vp.29_file" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a>. The page also describes how to specify custom volume rendering presets.</p>
