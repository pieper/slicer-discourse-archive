<p>I have a fMRI nifti file of that I need the skull to be extracted from.</p>
<p>I first set up an Image mask using segmentation wizard, to highlight the brain.<br>
After finishing segmentation wizard, I tried saving the masks as .nii.gz files, but when I open the files on my desktop, a folder is created, but empty.</p>
<p>Is there another way to use the highlighted masks to crop out the regions that I don’t want for my fMRI scans.</p>
<p>I have tried different modules to try to crop out my 4D image, but can’t seem to figure it out.</p>
