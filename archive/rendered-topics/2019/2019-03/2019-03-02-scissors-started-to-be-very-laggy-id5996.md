<p>Operating system: MacOS Mojave;<br>
Slicer version: 4.10.1</p>
<p>Actual behavior:  after vessel segmentation  i use scissors which begin to be very laggy. Few months before same taks went smoothly with similar CT data.<br>
All thing with the system seems to be fine. What can be the reason for it and how to fix it?</p>
