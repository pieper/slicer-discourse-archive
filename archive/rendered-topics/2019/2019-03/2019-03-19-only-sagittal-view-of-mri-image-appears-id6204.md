<p>Operating system: Mac OS Sierra<br>
Slicer version: 4.8<br>
Expected behavior: There should be A saggital, coronal, and transverse views of the MRI DICOM data that I am inserting.<br>
Actual behavior: Only the saggital view is present and is faulty so I am not even able to skim through different layers of the MRI Data.</p>
