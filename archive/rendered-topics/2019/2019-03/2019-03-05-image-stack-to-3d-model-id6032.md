<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I’m new to 3DSlicer, and I have to create a 3D model from a stack of roughly 2000 .jpg images. In the documentation (link below), it says to uncheck the “Single File” option for each image, and I was wondering if there was a way to do so for the stack all at once. As it stands now, I would have to uncheck each option for over a thousand images for over 30 stacks.</p>

<p>Maybe you have selected all the files in the stack. You only need to load one. The documentation page that you referred to contains this note: <em>Important: do not choose multiple files or the entire parent folder, just a single file of the sequence.</em></p>
