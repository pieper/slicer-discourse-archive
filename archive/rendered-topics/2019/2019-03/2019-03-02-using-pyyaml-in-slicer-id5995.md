<p>Is there a way to use a yaml parser in Slicer?</p>
<p>I tried pip installing pyyaml using the instructions described on this page: <a href="https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/Nightly/Developers/Python_scripting#How_to_run_pip_.3F" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/Nightly/Developers/Python_scripting#How_to_run_pip_.3F</a> and it seems to have installed pyyaml correctly. However, the module doesn’t seem to load when I import yaml? I also just restarted Slicer, ran <code>import yaml</code> on the Python Interactor  and got an error saying “No Module named yaml”?</p>
