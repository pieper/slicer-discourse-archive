<p>Hi Dear 3DSlicer’s developers and users</p>
<p>I want to contour an organ manually with 3DSlicer? Produce RTSTRUCT with 3D Slicer! Is it possible or I have to do it in TPS and import it?</p>
<p>Best<br>
Mery</p>

<p>Absolutely it is possible.  There are tutorials on using the segment editor here:</p>

<p>If you want to export RTSTRUCT, you also need to install the SlicerRT extension.</p>
