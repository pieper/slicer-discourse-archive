<p>The crosshair is often covered by a largle model. So, can I change the scale in 3d windows not the thick</p>

<p>Normally you would visualize points on a visible surface, not inside. You can also make models semi-transparent.</p>
<p>I’ll soon work on improving crosshair display. I’ll try to take this request into account.</p>
