<p>You can adjust the resolution of the segmentation to be able to represent arbitrarily fine details. See this post for details: <a href="https://discourse.slicer.org/t/i-cannot-remove-ridges-in-3d-segmentation/4792/2?u=lassoan" class="inline-onebox">I cannot remove "ridges" in 3D segmentation</a></p>
