<p>I noticed since a few weeks that new markups are available, like angle, line and curves.</p>
<p>It seems to me that they are meant for view annotations only, which is very good. Are they also used in computation in some modules ?</p>
<p>In the event of annotation role only, can arrows with free text be implemented likewise ? For now, we can always draw a line and change the markup labels to highlight anything.</p>
<p>That’s not a real feature request, just to have your views.</p>
<p>Regards.</p>

<p>They are replacing custom annotations and computations that have been previously implemented in various public and private extensions. Probably quantifications will be available in a couple of months.</p>
<p>You can specify free text for any control point of any markups. We might add displacement of labels (so that you can position the label manually). Probably we’ll probably add a node label, which will show the markups node name and quantification result.</p>
