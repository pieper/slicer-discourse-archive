<p>Hi Luca, welcome to the Slicer community. You can find instructions for installing extensions here: <a href="https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/Nightly/SlicerApplication/ExtensionsManager#Installing_an_extension" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/Nightly/SlicerApplication/ExtensionsManager#Installing_an_extension</a></p>
<p>Note that since Slicer is open-source, with all documentation available online, indexed by search engines, you should be able to find lots of answers by typing your question into Google.</p>
