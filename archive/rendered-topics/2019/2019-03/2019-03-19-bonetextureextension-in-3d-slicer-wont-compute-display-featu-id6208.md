<p>Operating system: Windows/ Mac 10.14<br>
Slicer version: 4.10.1<br>
Expected behavior: Compute and display feature maps<br>
Actual behavior: Does not.</p>
<p>I can’t get the extension to compute or display feature maps. I am able to get the actual feature set (numerical output for the features). Please help.</p>

<p>Could you describe what exactly you did (bullet-point list of steps you performed), what you expected to happen (something to appear somewhere, etc.), and what happened instead?</p>
