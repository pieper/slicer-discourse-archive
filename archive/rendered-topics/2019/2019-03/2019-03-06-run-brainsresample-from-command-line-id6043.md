<p>Hi all,<br>
I would like to run BRAINSResample from Windows command line.</p>
<p>I tried to follow <a href="https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/Nightly/Developers/FAQ#How_to_call_a_CLI_module_from_command-line.3F" rel="nofollow noopener">this guide</a> but I get nothing (I press enter and I get a new line), both from cmd and from text file where I rerdirect the output.</p>
<p>Any idea?</p>
<p>Thanks a lot.</p>
<p>Paolo</p>

<p>Getting console output on Windows has always been a mystery for me, and I don’t think I ever figured out a workaround.</p>
<p>Maybe notes from this bug submitted back in 2013 about this issue will help you: <a href="https://issues.slicer.org/view.php?id=2934" rel="nofollow noopener">https://issues.slicer.org/view.php?id=2934</a>. But reading the notes in that issue, I do not see an actionable workaround. Maybe I just need to re-read it several more times, but fortunately I don’t have to use Windows, not at the moment anyway.</p>

<p>Ok…I got it.<br>
I thought I was not running it properly (on Linux I can successfully run it).<br>
I think I will run it in Linux.</p>
<p>Thanks a lot!</p>
