<p>What do yo mean by not good? VTK’s <a href="https://vtk.org/documentation/" rel="nofollow noopener">documentation</a> (VTK textbook, VTK doxygen, and the huge collection of test and examples) is much better than I’ve seen for any other libraries. Start with reading the VTK textbook 2-3 times, cover to cover.</p>
