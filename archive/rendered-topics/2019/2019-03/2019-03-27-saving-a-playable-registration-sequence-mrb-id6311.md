<p>Operating system: Windows 10<br>
Slicer version: 4.11<br>
Expected behavior: A 3DSlicer playable file -object- 5-10 second sequence<br>
Actual behavior: The registration workflow, takes a nrrd file -15 frames for instance- and  renders the three channels (id=“vtkMRMLSliceNode1”, id=“vtkMRMLSliceNode2”, id=“vtkMRMLSliceNode3”) in window “vtkMRMLViewNode1”.  I need help saving this window sequence (same # of frames)  in a file than can later be reproduced. What happens now is that the end user needs to manually reproduce the registratio over and over again everytime  he/she wants to the results.</p>
<p>My most needed help is how to get the "“vtkMRMLViewNode1” rendering and what kind of file would that be? MRB perhaps?.</p>
<p>Thanks<br>
Fabian</p>
