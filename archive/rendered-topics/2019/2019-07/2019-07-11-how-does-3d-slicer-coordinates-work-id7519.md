<p>I have two 3D images. One image is much bigger because the other image is cropped from the bigger image. Let’s say I random crop a 50x50x50 image from the 100x100x100. How would I be able to know the coordinates of the smaller image (inside the bigger image) using python when I import both of those?</p>
<p>I tried using the RAS method but it seems that the coordinates I am getting are wrong.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

<p>This should be a good place to start: <a href="https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Coordinate_systems" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Coordinate_systems</a></p>
