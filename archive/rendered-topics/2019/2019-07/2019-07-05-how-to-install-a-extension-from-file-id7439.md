<p>hi, i want install screenCapture extension on my windows computer,but my slicer’s extensions manager can’t show anything(Perhaps the reason for the network)，so, i want install this extension from file, but I don’t know where I should go to download this file. Can you give the file   or link that can download it? Thank you very much.</p>
<p>Best wish,<br>

<p>Screen Capture module is included in Slicer (shows up in the Utilities category in the module list).</p>
