<p>Hello,<br>
I have been trying to view DICOM CT scans -I have imported the files but when I load them to view the files show on the left as being live but the actual views (R,Y,G) are just black with nothing visible. However, when I click ‘show zoomed slice’ I can see zoomed in sections of the CT images and move through them in the small box on the bottom left of the screen,<br>
Any suggestions much appreciated,</p>
<p>Many Thanks</p>

<p>This typically happens when your graphics card does not meet minimum requirements (your computer is more than 6-8 years old). See some more details <a href="https://discourse.slicer.org/t/images-cannot-be-seen-after-loading-data/6154/4">here</a>. If upgrading your graphics card drivers does not help then probably you need to upgrade your computer. If your computer is a recent one then send us the application log (menu: Help / Report a bug).</p>
