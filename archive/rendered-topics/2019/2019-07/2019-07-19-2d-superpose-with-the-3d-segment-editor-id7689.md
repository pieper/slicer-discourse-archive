<p>Is it possible to match a photo or an import picture with the 3d segment . I would like to match a picture of a patient with the 3d segment<br>
Thanks a lot</p>

<p>You cannot do it very accurately,l. For example you can show a photo in a slice view and show volume rendering of a volume in front of it in a 3D view. You can also blend two images in a slice view. Since the photo is a single-slice image, it is simpler to keep that as is and apply a transform to the volumetric image to position and scale it.</p>
