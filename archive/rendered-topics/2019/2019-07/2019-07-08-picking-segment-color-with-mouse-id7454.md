<p>In the Segment Editor is there a way to select a segment color with the mouse? I’m doing voxel editing and currently, I need to find the color in the list, which is not alphabetical by segment name. With over a hundred segments it is hard to scroll through the list and find the color I want.</p>

<p>Hi Bill - one way is to use the Color smudge option in the Paint effect.  If you just click without dragging it selects the segment without painting anything.</p>
