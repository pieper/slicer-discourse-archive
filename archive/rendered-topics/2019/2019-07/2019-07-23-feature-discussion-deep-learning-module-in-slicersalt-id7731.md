<p>This is a discussion page for a new feature in SlicerSALT under development.</p>
<p>Goal: Add a module to SlicerSALT allowing for deep learning classification support.</p>
<p>Features:</p>
<ul>
<li>python module</li>
<li>use of keras for deep learning</li>
<li>n-class classification</li>
<li>fully connected networks with predefined features (customizable)</li>
<li>convolutional networks via spherical mapping (kernels defined on sphere) with predefined features (customizable)</li>
<li>generation and execution of keras scripts that can be edited by users (if they are experts)</li>
<li>tutorial with use cases</li>
</ul>

<p>Any suggestion/comments are welcome. But yes, we/I need to flesh this out with more details. I am not asking for a specific question, more wanting to hear from potential users whether there are things we should make sure to include &amp; support in that SALT module.</p>
