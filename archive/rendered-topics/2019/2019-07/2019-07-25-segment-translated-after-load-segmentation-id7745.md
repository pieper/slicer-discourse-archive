<p>Hello,</p>
<p>For some reason, after I load a segmentation in my module, I see the segment move by itself from its correct place in the image to a lower position. This happens immediately, every time I load this segmentation.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

<p>Thank you for reporting this. I don’t remember seeing anything like this before.</p>
<p>Can you reproduce this with the latest stable or preview version of Slicer? If yes, could you share the scene so that we can investigate? If not, then please describe the series of steps that we can follow to reproduce the problem.</p>

<p>Thank you for your reply. Yes, I can definitely share the scene. Can I email the scene and files to you? What’s your contact email?</p>
