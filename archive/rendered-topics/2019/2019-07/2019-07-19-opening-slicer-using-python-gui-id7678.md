<p>Hello!<br>
I’m about to create a gui using python. I only need to display the module “models” and the mrml. Can I launch slicer in the background somehow?<br>
I’ve seen the slicelet option but those are written within python interact or environment, right?<br>
Thanks in advance!<br>
Fabiola</p>

<p>You can create a Python scripted module as explained in <a href="https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/Nightly/Training#PerkLab.27s_Slicer_bootcamp_training_materials" rel="nofollow noopener">this Slicer programming tutorial</a>. In the Qt designer you will find the same widgets used in Data and Models module GUI.</p>
