<p>Hi.</p>
<p>I looked around the forum and saw a lot of 4D Volume (nrrd file).</p>
<p>I searched to find out about 4D Volume, but I did not know.</p>
<p>What is the difference between 3D Volume and 4D Volume?</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>The 4th dimension is often time, but can be diffusion gradients or segmentation.  Maybe you can start by looking at <a href="https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/4.10/Modules/MultiVolumeExplorer" rel="nofollow noopener">the multivolme support</a>.  Feel free to follow up if you have more questions.</p>
