<p>It should be possible to register brain MRIs with “General registration (BRAINS)” module. See examples <a href="https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/Nightly/Registration/RegistrationLibrary" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a>.</p>

<p>To be able to help, we would need much more details about what you tried exactly, what you expected to happen, and what happened instead. Provide description of steps and sample data (but at least screenshots).</p>
