Slicer version: Any</p>
<p>Does Slicer have an elliptical measurement tool?  I need to measure the circumference of structures which may be perfect circles or ellipses.</p>

<p>It seems that this message fell through the cracks (probably because it was originally posted in the “Community” category instead of “Support”). If you still need help with this then let us know.</p>
