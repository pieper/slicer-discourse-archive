<p>Hi everyone,<br>
I’m developing a extension of 3DSlicer 4.10 for surgical planification in urolithiasis (Urology).<br>
My concern is about the valaidity of 3DSlicer’s ability to quantifiy segments.</p>
<p>Is there any publication yet on the quantification of segments (volumetry) ?</p>
<p>Thx for answers !</p>

<p>3D Slicer’s volume measurements are expected to be highly accurate. See for example <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/286309312_In_vivo_volume_measurement_of_the_ventricles_of_the_dog_Canis_familiaris_with_MRI" rel="nofollow noopener">this paper</a>. Difference between volume computed by 3D Slicer found to have 0.04% difference compared to ground truth (measured using a plexiglass phantom).</p>
<p>Note that while Slicer is widely used in clinical studies (proven by <a href="http://www.spl.harvard.edu/publications/pages/display/?collection=0&amp;entriesPerPage=50" rel="nofollow noopener">thousands of papers</a>), you still need to ensure that it is suitable for <em>your</em> project, by following guidelines of your institution.</p>
