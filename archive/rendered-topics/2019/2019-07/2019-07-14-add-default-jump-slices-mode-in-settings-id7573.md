<p>The image below shows the three jump slices options. On application start, or when a scene is closed, it defaults to ‘offset’.</p>

<p>I could not find an option in ‘Settings’  to choose a default mode. I mostly use the ‘Centered’ mode with Shift+Mouse move. Hence this feature request to add a user prefered default mode for jump slices.</p>
<p>Thank you for considering.</p>

<p>There are many adjustment possibilities in Slicer and only a small fraction is exposed in the application settings.</p>
<p>Currently, you can set slice jump mode in your <code>.slicerrc.py</code> file as shown <a href="https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/Nightly/ScriptRepository#Set_crosshair_jump_mode_to_centered_by_default" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>If many other user will request this adjustment then we will make it more easily accessible in the application settings.</p>
