<p><a class="mention" href="/u/jbvimort">@jbvimort</a>:</p>
<p>I have a question regarding the extension that you’ve implemented, specifically regarding how the appxorimation of the trabecular region was done. Was it using the plate model? a spherical model? other methods?</p>
<p>I am interested in using the spherical model described in this paper (<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1365-2818.1997.1340694.x" rel="nofollow noopener">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1365-2818.1997.1340694.x</a>) and I am wondering if there is a quick way to adjust the existing module to use this.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time!</p>
