<p>Operating system: CentOS 7<br>
Slicer version: 4.10</p>
<p>Hello Slicer community,</p>
<p>I have recently started working on MR imaging. My work actually involves the development of the tool for improving tractography visualization. Because of the modular support and extensions capability I have chosen 3D slicer to start with.</p>
<p>I want to integrate CUDA acceleration in slicer for some mathematical modeling tasks (not volume rendering). Is there a way to integrate CUDA with slicer python?</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>In recent Slicer Preview Releases, you can <a href="https://discourse.slicer.org/t/use-full-power-of-python-in-slicer/7162">use CUDA in Slicer’s Python environment the same way as you would use it in any other Python3 environment</a>.</p>
