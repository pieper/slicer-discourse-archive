Hello, I’m new here and in need of some assistance with exporting SEEG segmentation in SEEG Assistant module. Do you know the meaning of the electrode parameters here？ For example, D08-05AM.<br>
Thank you.</p>

<p>It seems that the author of the SEEG extension does not read this forum. I would recommend to add an issue to the <a href="https://github.com/mnarizzano/SEEGA/issues" rel="nofollow noopener">extension’s GitHub repository</a>.</p>
