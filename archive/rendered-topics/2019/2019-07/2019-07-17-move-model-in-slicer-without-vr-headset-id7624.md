<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am putting in a request to be able to move a model around in Slicer, without VR headset and controllers. Right now, we can only move a surgical tool (model) around in VR mode, but we would like to control this model without VR headset and controllers (using mouse tracking).</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>You can move a node around by grabbing with the mouse in 3D view by applying a transform to the node then in Transforms module check “Visible in 3D view” checkbox in Display / Interaction section.</p>
