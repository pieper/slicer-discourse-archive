<p>Hi</p>
<p>I would like to have a plot displayed on a module user interface rather than within the main layout. The code examples add a vtkMRMLPlotChartNode and then switch to a layout that contains a plot view.</p>
<p>I have tried creating a UI with qMRMLPlotWidget but cannot connect to it.</p>
<p>Any help greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Many thanks</p>
<p>Robin</p>
