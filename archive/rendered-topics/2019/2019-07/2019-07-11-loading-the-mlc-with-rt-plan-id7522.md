<p>Slicer version:4.10.1<br>
Hi 3D Slicer experts and all<br>
I have  RT Plan which contains the MLC for radiation field. Are the edges of radiation field defined by MLC? in the other words , does MLC supported in 3D Slicer or similar to block is not supported?<br>
Thanks a lot</p>

<p>We do not have MLC support currently. It used to work in a rudimentary way, but the person developing it left the project, and nobody was able to take it on. It would not be a huge work to add it in a good way, but not a small one either. Please let us know if you are able to contribute, or if you have any suggestions or further questions!</p>
