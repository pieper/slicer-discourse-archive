<p>Hi all! I am having some problems downloading the extensions. I have installed 4.10.2 version for MAC. The extension manager does not work, and i do not understand the reason.<br>
I want to make a registration in brain IMR, do you recommend some modules?<br>
Thank you!</p>

<p>It could be a proxy issue and maybe you need to manually install.  Discussion below should help.</p>

    I just downloaded 4.8.1 on my MacBook to test out the program for our work with DTI and tractography, and when I open the extension manager, it fails to load any of the extensions. It stops around 66% every time. I’ve tried shutting down the program and opening it back up, uninstalling and reinstalling, etc. I even downloaded the nightly build to see if it would work, and while it said it had loaded to 100%, no extensions would show up. Any suggestions?

<p>Have you found the solution?</p>
<p>Maybe you have not installed Slicer - see information here: <a href="https://discourse.slicer.org/t/slicer-app-installation-hint-for-mac-installer/6329" class="inline-onebox">Slicer app installation "hint" for mac installer</a></p>
