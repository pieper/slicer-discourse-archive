<p>Hello, I am wondering if there is a good method to show nii.gz files in the same scene (one is ultrasound volume and another is MRI volume) in 3D slicer. I tried to load both data at the same time but it doesn’t work (It can only show one of them). Thanks.</p>

<p>To see the two volumes at the same time, you could translate one of them applying a  transform.<br>
