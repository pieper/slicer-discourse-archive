<p>As to me, I wonder whether it can be transformed into the format of sldprt in solidworks so we can revamp the model more accurate. Thank you for your excellent work.</p>

<p>Conversion from mesh to engineering CAD software solid part is a mostly unsolved problem. See details in this topic: <a href="https://discourse.slicer.org/t/use-segmentations-in-cad-or-fem-software/1626/58" class="inline-onebox">Use segmentations in CAD or FEM software - #58 by lassoan</a></p>

</aside>
<p>How can you make the model more accurate in a CAD software where you cannot even see the original image and model in the same view? What would you like to achieve?</p>
