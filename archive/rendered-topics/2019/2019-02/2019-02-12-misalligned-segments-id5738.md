<p>I have two segmentations on my work, but as you can see from the screenshot i took on 3D view, they are not aligned. How can i fix this?<br>

<p>Hi - to get help you’ll need to provide more context about how these were created.</p>

<p>I make manual segmentation on axial view. I oversampled my dicom volume in order to get higher quality segments. After a while i realized my segments didn’t look right (i asked about this in a previous post),so i discovered this misalignment when i looked at 3d view. Let me know if there is anything else i need to add.</p>
