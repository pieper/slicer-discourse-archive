<p>I have almost finished my Nuclear Medicine Dosimetry module, however I have some questions about integration and publication</p>
<ol>
<li>I have requested a wiki account but I have no answer yet.</li>
<li>Where do I have to publish the source code? Github, slicer git?</li>
<li>What kind of documentation do you expect? Manual, User guide, only wiki?</li>
<li>How do I control the push requests and how to control bug tracker?</li>
</ol>
<p>I need alpha testers and some developers advices</p>

<p>You’ll want to look into adding your module as an extension. Read the <a href="https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/Nightly/Developers/Tutorials/BuildTestPackageDistributeExtensions" rel="nofollow noopener">BuildTestPackageDistributeExtensions</a> wiki page. On that page there is also a link to the <a href="https://github.com/Slicer/ExtensionsIndex/blob/master/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md" rel="nofollow noopener">checklist</a> for contributing to the extensions index.</p>
<p>This should answer your questions from above about where to put your code, documentation, testing, etc.</p>
