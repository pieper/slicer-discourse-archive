<p>I have MRI images with a low signal to noise ratio. could 3Dslicer  enhance the images so the image contrast becomes better?</p>
<p>thanks</p>

<p>Generally the best you can do is trade off, say, between smoothness vs resolution, using various filters.  A lot of useful image processing filters are available via the SimpleFilters module.</p>
