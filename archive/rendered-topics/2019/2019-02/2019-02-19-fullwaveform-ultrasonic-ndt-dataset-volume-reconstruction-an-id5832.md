<p>I have a raw dataset of  full waveform ultrasonic data across an area  (NDT ultrasonic data-set).<br>
I want to convert this data to the 3D image matrix and slice it similar to the youtube video shown <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTz0nwAmeMo" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Real-time volume reconstruction using a motorized ultrasound probe - YouTube</a> for volume reconstruction and visualization .</p>
<p>Do you know whether the 3Dslicer  has a function that can import and perform such conversion?<br>
or can anyone give some basic tutorial importing custom data to 3Dslicer format</p>
<p>-your help and comments are greatly appreciated I am looking forward to receiving responses</p>
