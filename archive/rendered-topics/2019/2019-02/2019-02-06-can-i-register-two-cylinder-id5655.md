<p>I have two unequal cylinders (also know the coordinates of their endpoints). Can 3dslicer automatically create a matrix that eventually overlaps their centerlines?</p>

<p>Sounds like you just need to come up with the formula for the transform with a little python script.  A computer graphics textbook can explain what calculations are needed.</p>
