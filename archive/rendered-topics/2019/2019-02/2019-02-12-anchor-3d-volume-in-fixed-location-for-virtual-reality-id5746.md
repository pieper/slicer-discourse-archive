<p>Hi,<br>
I am currently working in a Project where I am trying to display the 3D Volume of Medical data on Virtual Reality but I cannot anchor the fixed location. Every time I open the Slicer 3D and load my file I have to again rearrange my 3D volume location. I was wondering if there is a way to anchor the location in a fixed location of the Data so that I don’t have to rearrange every time when I open the volume in Virtual Reality.<br>
Thanks.</p>

<p>You could probably select the “centered” option when loading the volume. See <a href="https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/4.10/SlicerApplication/LoadingData#Show_Options" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/4.10/SlicerApplication/LoadingData#Show_Options</a></p>
