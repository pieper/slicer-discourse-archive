<p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>I was finally able to upload a 4d CT data set and see the cine of volume render in my laptop. But when I click the virtual reality display, the virtual reality display screen does not show the cine model. I checked the display mirror option and it was fine. Is there any fix to it.</p>
<p>Also how to get rid of the bones in volume render. If I use shift slider, it also removes the heart and can’t crop the bones without affecting the heart. Any thoughts?<br>
Have attached the video.<br>

<p>Will appreciate the help.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
