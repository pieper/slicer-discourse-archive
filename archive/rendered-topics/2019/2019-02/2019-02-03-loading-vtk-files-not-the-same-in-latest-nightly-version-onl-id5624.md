<p>Dear 3DSlicer community, thank you for all your constant efforts making this software better. I just downloaded the latest nightly version and I no longer see the option to open my vtk files as I used to to see the fiber bundles. Instead I only have the option of a model (or also scalar overlay and volume but those are definitely not helpful for me). Is the feature hidden somewhere I do not see or this is a bug that needs to be fixed in the latest nightly version of 3D Slicer? Please advise. Thanks a lot!</p>
<p>Best regards,<br>
Magda.</p>

<p>Hi -</p>
<p>For the latest versions, tractography support is now in <a href="http://dmri.slicer.org/" rel="nofollow noopener">SicerDMRI</a> which you can install via the extension manager.</p>
<p>Best,<br>
Steve</p>

<p>Dear Steve,</p>
<p>Thank you so much for the clarification! I really appreciate it. I did not think of that. I just did and worked great.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
