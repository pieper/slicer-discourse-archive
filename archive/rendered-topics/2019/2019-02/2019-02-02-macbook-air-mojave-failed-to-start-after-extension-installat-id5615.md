<p>The laptop fails to start or Slicer?<br>
Which extension did you install?<br>
Does Slicer start correctly if you disconnect from the network (unplug the network cable and disable wifi)?<br>
Does Slicer start correctly if you remove <a href="https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/Nightly/SlicerApplication/ApplicationSettings#Settings_file_location" rel="nofollow noopener">Slicer settings file</a>?</p>
