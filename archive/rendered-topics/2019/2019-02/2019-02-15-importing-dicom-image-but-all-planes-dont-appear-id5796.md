<p>Operating system: Mac<br>
Slicer version:4.10.0<br>
Expected behavior: When importing an ROI DICOM image from MicroView the three planes of the image should appear.<br>
Actual behavior:When importing an ROI DICOM image from MicroView the three planes do not appear fully. For each plane, the image is compressed into only half of the plane’s view and it is not letting me adjust each plane.</p>
