<p>I have DICOM files from a brain MRI but they are separated into axial, coronal, and sagittal series and thus I cant work with them together as one volume. If I try the other two planes appear blurry. Is there  way to combined the three series?</p>

<p>In short, there is no way to effectively combine these series. See details in this topic: <a href="https://discourse.slicer.org/t/combining-volumes-what-am-i-missing/2941/2?u=lassoan" class="inline-onebox">Combining volumes - what am I missing?</a></p>
