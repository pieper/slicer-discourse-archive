<p>Hi all</p>
<p>I am looking to segment bones in a multivolume sequence. This is a set  of 3 D volumes with 40-60 frames. Is there a method that I could do one frame and then automatically get it applied to subsequent frames please. Bones are translating and rotation from frame to frame.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
