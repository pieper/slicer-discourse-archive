<p>Problem report for Slicer 4.11.0-2019-02-19 macosx-amd64: [please describe expected and actual behavior] I am trying to place landmarks using the landmark registration module but I cannot move the landmarks once they’ve been placed about 95% of the time. It makes placing the landmarks correctly nearly impossible.</p>

<p>Thanks for the report <a class="mention" href="/u/yalshara">@yalshara</a> - this is a known issue (known annoyance) discussed in <a href="https://issues.slicer.org/view.php?id=4634" rel="nofollow noopener">this issue report</a>.  Note there is a workaround, which is to pan the image a bit (middle button) and then the landmark becomes selectable.</p>
<p>The new widget infrastructure should fix this in a few weeks.</p>
