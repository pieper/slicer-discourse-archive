<p>Dear Andras,</p>
<p>We have started to develop an experiment to connect the magic leap with live ultrasound preview.  (we have a minimum focal distance at 38 cm with the magic leap so it can work well).</p>
<p>We are working with GE c5 ultrasound device.</p>
<p>Can we ask your advice how would you get the live video US signal into magic leap via wifi? Which protocol is preferred for the live streaming?</p>
<p>I guess you have tried the same with the Hollolens?<br>
Thanks Amir</p>
