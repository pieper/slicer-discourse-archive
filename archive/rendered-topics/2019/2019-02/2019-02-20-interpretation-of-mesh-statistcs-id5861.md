<p>Hello 3D slicer team!</p>
<p>I am currently working on a university project trying to find the differences between the right and left side of skulls.  I run the mesh statistics and I need to see if the differences are significant or not. Should I use for the statistics the absolute number of the maximum, minimun and mean value cause I think that I need just how big is the difference between the right and left side of each area or should I include in the statistics the integer values?<br>
Thanks a lot for your time!</p>

<p>These could be all suitable metrics, depending on what the clinical goal/requirements are.</p>

<p>Thanks a lot for the response!<br>
I am going to use all these values for the stats, but I don’t know if I should use the absolute number of the  values or the actual numbers with the signs (some of the mean values are negative numbers).</p>
