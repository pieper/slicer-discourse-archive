<p>Hey guys,</p>
<p>I am struggling a lot with extension manager of Binary 3DSlicer version and all my developer version ones: Every time I open extension manager it either collapse right away or loads but freezes somewhere.</p>
<p>I use Linux Mint 18.3 Cinnamon 64 bit.</p>
<p>I’ve tried with three or two latest versions of 3DSlicer, both developer and binary versions.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>Does it help if you remove all files and folders from your application settings folder (where Slicer.ini is located)?</p>
<p>Does it crash if you are disconnected from the internet?</p>
<p>Can you get a stack trace of the crash?</p>

<p>I’ll check the points you suggested.<br>
I just tried in another Linux mint machine and it happened again.</p>
<p>Then, I tried in my Windows 10 (updated) installation and everything worked fine, nice and smooth.</p>

<p>Please also check this thread and try the suggested solutions (force using OpenGL compatibility profile, update your display driver): <a href="https://discourse.slicer.org/t/opening-extension-manager-makes-slicer-crash-on-linux/7589" class="inline-onebox">Opening extension manager makes Slicer crash on Linux</a></p>
