<p>Using latest Slicer Preview Release, you can draw a closed curve on the skull using Markups module and compute the surface area as described here: <a href="https://discourse.slicer.org/t/how-can-i-calculate-an-area-on-a-ct-image-i-can-calculate-volumes-mm-3-but-not-areas-mm-2/1549/3" class="inline-onebox">How can I calculate an area on a CT image. I can calculate volumes (mm^3) but not areas (mm^2)</a></p>
<p>If this is not what you need then let us know. There are some other options, too.</p>
