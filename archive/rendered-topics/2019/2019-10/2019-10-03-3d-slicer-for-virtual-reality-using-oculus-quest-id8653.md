<p>Hi,<br>
I’m just started using 3D Slicer. My question is how do I use 3D Slicer with Oculus Quest? Should I import a plugin in unity? I’ve looked at <a href="https://github.com/KitwareMedical/SlicerVirtualReality" rel="nofollow noopener">https://github.com/KitwareMedical/SlicerVirtualReality</a> but seems like it supports SteamVR &amp; OpenVR. Quest uses Android SDK.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Slicer supports all OpenVR compatible headsets. Oculus Quest requires third-party application to run OpenVR content. Depending on network quality, the update rates will be probably somewhat lower than by using a headset that supports OpenVR natively.</p>
<p>You can get a Windows Mixed Reality headset for about half price of an Oculus Quest and that headset works natively with OpenVR.</p>

<p>Hello M. Lasso,</p>
<p>As of today are Oculus Quest 1 or 2 compatible with SLICER VR?<br>
What is the third party mentionned in your post?</p>
<p>Many thanks in advance,<br>

<p>I haven’t tried an Oculus Quest with Slicer, but you can search the web for how to use Oculus Quest with OpenVR (the VR interface that Slicer uses). See for example here: <a href="https://uploadvr.com/how-to-play-pc-vr-oculus-quest-2/">https://uploadvr.com/how-to-play-pc-vr-oculus-quest-2/</a></p>

<p>Thank you for the feedback.</p>
<p>Actually, I don’t have the Oculus Link.</p>
<p>I found this article : <a href="https://uploadvr.com/quest-openxr-prototype-support/#:~:text=Just%20to%20clear%20up%20any,on%20Oculus%20Rift%20store%20apps" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://uploadvr.com/quest-openxr-prototype-support/#:~:text=Just%20to%20clear%20up%20any,on%20Oculus%20Rift%20store%20apps</a>.</p>
<p>They mentionned : While Open VR works on all PC VR headsets, it doesn’t support Android headsets like Quest and due to Facebook’s policies cannot be used on Oculus Rift store apps.</p>
<p>Quest works with Android SDK, I assume it should not be compatible unfortunately.</p>

<p>The article is 8 month old. The situation may be different now. Anyway, the Oculus Quest is not a great headset for PC-based VR, because it is optimized for rendering on its own.</p>
