<p>If you mean as interacting with a 3D object? If you make segmentation and export your segmentation as PLY/OBJ/STL, you should be able to import that model into newer versions powerpoint.</p>
<p>If you mean 2D capture, you can either use the screen capture or scene view tools of Slicer (the little camera icons on the toolbar) and save them as PNG/JPG etc…</p>
