<p>Usually there is no “perfect and easy way” of doing segmentation. You can expect to spend a couple of days with finding a good segmentation workflow, especially if the segmentation task is hard or if you are new to Slicer.</p>
<p>Here are tutorials that should help you to get started: <a href="https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/Nightly/Training#Segmentation" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/Nightly/Training#Segmentation</a></p>
