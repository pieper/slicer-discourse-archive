<p>Yes, the same way as Slicer.</p>
<p>In general, Slicer is much more flexible and can do much more than Mimics, but Mimics has some unique features, too. Slicer is completely free, open-source, customizable, and extensible, while Mimics is closed and very expensive.</p>

<p>What do you mean by being expensive so it can’t be easily installed? may you send me download link?</p>

<p>There is no free download link for Mimics. You have to buy that software for a few ten thousand dollars.</p>

<p>but why  I could download free ? that name is  ( <strong>Materialise Mimics Innovation Suite Medical</strong> )</p>

<p>That’s a demo version, perhaps functional for a week or too.</p>

<p>As an experienced Mimics user I must admit that I don’t use it that often anymore. Although it’s very powerfull (and also very expensive) I’ve switched to Slicer.<br>
Slicer has a steeper learning curve (at least to me it had), but once you get to know, you’re gone like it.</p>
<p>Nowadays I do all my MRI segmenting with Slicer.</p>

<p>a question mr leon , Mimics produce volume mesh file? and too 3d model  without mesh?</p>

<p>I have used both Mimics and Slicer for many years–I use Slicer more now, but Mimics is pretty easy to learn.<br>
You can request a free evaluation license of Mimics, usually with multiple modules.</p>

<p>You can generate volumetric meshes in Slicer from segmentation using <a href="https://github.com/lassoan/SlicerSegmentMesher">SegmentMesher</a> extension.</p>
