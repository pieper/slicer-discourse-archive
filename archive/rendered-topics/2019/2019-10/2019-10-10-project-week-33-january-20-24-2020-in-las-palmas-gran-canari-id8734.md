<p>Background: The Project Week is a week-long hackathon of hands on activity in which medical image computing researchers create solutions using the open source image computing platform, <a href="http://www.slicer.org/" rel="nofollow noopener">3D Slicer</a>, and <a href="http://www.vtk.org/" rel="nofollow noopener">VTK</a>, <a href="http://www.itk.org/" rel="nofollow noopener">ITK</a>, <a href="http://www.cmake.org/" rel="nofollow noopener">CMake</a>, and <a href="http://www.cdash.org/" rel="nofollow noopener">CDash</a> libraries as well as <a href="http://ohif.org/" rel="nofollow noopener">OHIF</a>, <a href="https://cornerstonejs.org/" rel="nofollow noopener">Cornerstone</a>, <a href="https://github.com/dcmjs-org" rel="nofollow noopener">dcmjs</a>, <a href="https://kitware.github.io/vtk-js/" rel="nofollow noopener">vtkjs</a>, <a href="https://insightsoftwareconsortium.github.io/itk-js/" rel="nofollow noopener">itkjs</a>, <a href="https://www.dicomstandard.org/dicomweb/" rel="nofollow noopener">DICOMweb</a>, <a href="https://girder.readthedocs.io/" rel="nofollow noopener">Girder</a> and related web technologies. Participants work collaboratively on solutions that lie on the interfaces of the fields of computer science, mechanical engineering, biomedical engineering, and medicine. In contrast to conferences and workshops where the primary focus is to report results, the objective of the Project Week is to provide a venue for creators of medical image computing open-source software creators to collaboratively work.

<p>Are you using or would you like to use Slicer in the context of cloud computing and/or with GPUs? We’d like to hear from you.  It would be great to hear from you “in person” in a project week call as we gather use cases for future support in Slicer.</p>
