<p>I’m following these instructions:<br>
</p><div class="lazyYT" data-youtube-id="B_SC_WZgb5A" data-youtube-title="Convert a DICOM CT image to a 3D printable STL file using free software for PC" data-width="480" data-height="270" data-parameters="feature=oembed&amp;wmode=opaque&amp;start=80"></div><br>
But when I render the skull, the facial implants do not display.

<p>Hi - a couple suggestions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>search discourse for terms like ‘stl’ and ‘printing’ and you’ll get lots of hits for previous instructions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if you still have questions, post some screenshots of what kind of implants you are referring to and we can give specific feedback</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>You may also check out these segmentation tutorials, which describe how to create 3D printable STL files from DICOM files: <a href="https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/Nightly/Training#Segmentation" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/Nightly/Training#Segmentation</a></p>
