<p>I have converted Fiesta and SPGR images using DWIconvert into .nrrd files and it is stored as DWI file. I applied Transforms and it has stored as new transform and new displacement file.  Once I open to do metric test in General registration I could see only displacement file which is stored in convert section of Transform module. I cannot see any of nrrd original file in the list of moving and fixed image.   How to do metric test for these images.</p>
