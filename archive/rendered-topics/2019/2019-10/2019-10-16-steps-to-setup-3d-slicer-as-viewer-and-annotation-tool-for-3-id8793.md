<p>Hi I have requirement where I need to annotate 3D CT scan dicom image slices I would need visualization tool to be able to do so. Is it natural use case for 3D slicer workflow set up? If so can u please provide links that would help me to do this set up quickly and start manually annotating images. I have done image segmentation but I need a visual tool to see the results Thanks, Jiten</p>
