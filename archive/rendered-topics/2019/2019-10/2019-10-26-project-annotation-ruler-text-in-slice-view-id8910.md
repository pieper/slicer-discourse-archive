<p>Is it possible to project the text of a ruler (distance measurment) onto all slices instead of only the slice that the ruler is in. Similar to how a ruler can be projected in slice view.</p>

<p>This is an interesting idea. It could easily mislead users but if we can find a way to clearly indicate that the displayed distance is out-of-plane then it may work. We’ll add this to markups lines.</p>

<p>To make it less confusing, would it be possible instead to display the slice projection of the relevant measurement? E.g. if a length, display the component of that length based on the current slice instead of the actual length of the ruler.</p>
