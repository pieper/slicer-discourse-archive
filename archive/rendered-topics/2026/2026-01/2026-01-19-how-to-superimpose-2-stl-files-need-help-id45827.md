<p>I need help on how to superimpose 2 stl files to analyze tooth movements</p>

<p>There are many surface registration tools in Slicer. Two are Segment Registration in SlicerRT extension (<a href="https://github.com/SlicerRt/SegmentRegistration" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">GitHub - SlicerRt/SegmentRegistration: 3D Slicer extension for segment registration (aka fusion, contour propagation)</a>) and FastModelAlign in SlicerMorph (<a href="https://github.com/SlicerMorph/Tutorials/tree/main/FastModelAlign#readme" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Tutorials/FastModelAlign at main · SlicerMorph/Tutorials · GitHub</a>)</p>
<p>You can give those a try.</p>

<p>Do you know if any of these would work for my purpose? Which is aligning an intraoral scan (.stl file) with the maxilla (.dcm of CBCT).</p>

<p>No idea, you need to try it yourself.</p>

<p>I will give a try then.<br>
Thank you.<br>
And another question…<br>
Is it possible to analyse the degree and liner measurements.. After superimposing? Can we get how much torque is achieved.. And how many mms a tooth moved…?? Is it possible in 3d slicer?</p>

<p>You should be able to measure the displacement of the tooth either with markups, or by segmenting. Rest, IDK.</p>
