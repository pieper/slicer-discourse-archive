<p>Just to clarify, if I want to move between slices in the axial view, should I just use the slider? Or is there a different way of doing this?</p>

<p>You can also use arrow keys (click in the view to set keyboard focus)</p>

<p>Another fun way to do it is to hold shift while moving the mouse around in other slice views.</p>
