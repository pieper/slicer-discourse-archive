<p>Hi!</p>
<p>I work with FDM 3D printing, and recently found this new extension (Slicer-SurfaceFragmentsRegistration)<br>
<a href="https://github.com/sebastianandress/Slicer-SurfaceFragmentsRegistration/tree/master" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://github.com/sebastianandress/Slicer-SurfaceFragmentsRegistration/tree/master</a></p>
<p>but I don’t fully understand how to use it to make comparisons between models before and after 3d printing. Does it involve the digitalization of the 3d printed object?  Am I missing something?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for your time.</p>
