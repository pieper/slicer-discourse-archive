<p>Notes from today’s meeting:</p>
<h2><a name="p-131373-qt-6-progress-1" class="anchor" href="#p-131373-qt-6-progress-1" aria-label="Heading link"></a>Qt 6 progress</h2>
<ul>
<li>Rafael is testing versions on linux distributions</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="p-131373-windows-nightly-build-2" class="anchor" href="#p-131373-windows-nightly-build-2" aria-label="Heading link"></a>Windows nightly build</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://discourse.slicer.org/t/no-nightly-windows-releases-since-2025-12-22/45647">Problems</a> due to security policy changes / patches</li>
<li>Issues are resolved for now-- the window builds are there now.
<ul>
<li>But the <a href="https://slicer.cdash.org/viewTest.php?onlydelta&amp;buildid=4070279">tests that are now failing</a> are opengl-related errors, suggesting that the change to run the build task without login led to these test failures. We will keep this setting for now, since it’s better to at least have a Windows build and gradually deal with the small number (19) of failing tests.</li>
<li>For a longer-term solution we may get a new account created on bluestreak which would be allowed to auto-login</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In general it is important to solve how to run slicer on windows without a display for some use cases</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="p-131373-floating-point-exceptions-on-mac-3" class="anchor" href="#p-131373-floating-point-exceptions-on-mac-3" aria-label="Heading link"></a>Floating point exceptions on mac</h2>
<ul>
<li>See <a href="https://slicer.cdash.org/builds/4070265/tests?filters=%7B%22all%22%3A%5B%7B%22eq%22%3A%7B%22status%22%3A%22FAILED%22%7D%7D%5D%7D">failing tests</a></li>
<li>It would be nice if someone who has a mac build with debug mode can run these tests and see about them.</li>
</ul>
