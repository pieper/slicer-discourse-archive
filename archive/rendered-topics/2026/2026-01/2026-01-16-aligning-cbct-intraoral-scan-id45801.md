<p>I have a STL from an intraoral scan with 3shape, and a CBCT in dicom. How can I align these semi automatically using a few manual landmarks?</p>
<p>What I have:</p>
<p>1x Skull CBCT dicom (edit: I also have a segmentation of this from DentalSegmentator)</p>
<p>3x stl files from intraoral scan. 1 upper, 1 lower, 1 bite.</p>
<p>I want to align the upper intraoral scan to the upper jaw/teeth from the CBCT.</p>
