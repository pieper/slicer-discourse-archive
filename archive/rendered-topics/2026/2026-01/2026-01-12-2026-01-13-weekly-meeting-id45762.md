<p>Notes from the meeting:</p>
<h2><a name="p-131222-qt6-support-1" class="anchor" href="#p-131222-qt6-support-1" aria-label="Heading link"></a>Qt6 Support</h2>
<ul>
<li>James starting to succesfully build with Qt6 across platforms now</li>
<li>Should Qt be an external project, now that it uses cmake? There are good and bad aspects to this…</li>
<li>Given the <a href="https://endoflife.date/qt">Qt support schedule</a>, which version of Qt6 are we going to support? Maybe 6.11 is what we will roll out with.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="p-131222-macos-test-failures-2" class="anchor" href="#p-131222-macos-test-failures-2" aria-label="Heading link"></a>MacOS test failures</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://slicer.cdash.org/builds/4062294/tests?filters=%7B%22all%22%3A%5B%7B%22eq%22%3A%7B%22status%22%3A%22FAILED%22%7D%7D%5D%7D">Dashboard link</a></li>
<li>Dec 19 or so is when those started failing. May be related to the ITK <a href="https://github.com/Slicer/Slicer/pull/8842">changes introduced to support reading 2D transforms</a>. It may have to do with the floating point precision changes from that work.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="p-131222-factory-machines-3" class="anchor" href="#p-131222-factory-machines-3" aria-label="Heading link"></a>Factory machines</h2>
<ul>
<li>After Qt6 the next big project will be arm system support. We already have the factory machine</li>
<li>metroplex, the linux build machine, is pretty old and slated for replaement</li>
<li>We are trying to bring in another windows factory machine to take the load off bluestreak.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="p-131222-simpleitk-crash-on-linux-4" class="anchor" href="#p-131222-simpleitk-crash-on-linux-4" aria-label="Heading link"></a>SimpleITK crash on linux</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Slicer/Slicer/issues/8947">#8947</a></li>
<li>We should have Brad add the namespace, since this would be a minimal change and potentially be the easiest fix. And less unnecessarily risky than the option of removing a bunch of infrastructure.</li>
</ul>
