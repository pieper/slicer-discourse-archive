<p>The recent file history disables menu items when the referenced files are not found when Slicer starts. The missing files may be available again if they are on removable media. They may also never appear again and occupy space without purpose.</p>
<p>The only management option is ‘Clear History’. The feature request is to add a ‘Purge History’ option, which would simply remove the disabled menu items.</p>
<p>Perhaps another ‘Update History’ option also, which would refresh the menu items presentation if a removable media is available again.</p>

    Maybe this is what I noticed today where it was hanging at initialization and would finally load modules after a noticeable delay. This happening on launch of the application (not just first startup). I use a multi monitor setup with my HP laptop and so maybe had Slicer last up on a multiple monitor, but this hang I observed today was without any external displays connected.
