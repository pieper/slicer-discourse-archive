<p>Would anybody be able to advice how I can create heat maps for the trabecular bone of a particular skeletal element using Slicer?</p>

<p>You have explain what the heatmap would indicate. If it is something like structural properties Bonetexture extension may do it, but I don’t know its latest status.</p>

<p>I am basically trying to look at trabecular bone density patterns. Any idea if I can do that with this module?</p>

<p>I think you can, but I never actually used it. Here is their tutorial: <a href="https://github.com/Kitware/BoneTextureExtension/blob/master/Docs/BoneTextureExtensionTutorial_2017.pdf" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">BoneTextureExtension/Docs/BoneTextureExtensionTutorial_2017.pdf at master · Kitware/BoneTextureExtension · GitHub</a></p>

<p>Thank you! I shall give this a try. <a class="mention" href="/u/lassoan">@lassoan</a> and <a class="mention" href="/u/pieper">@pieper</a> are there other modules I should consider as well? Would you be able to advice on this please?</p>
