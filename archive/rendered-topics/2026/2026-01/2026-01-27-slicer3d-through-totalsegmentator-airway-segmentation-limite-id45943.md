<p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>I am working on airway segmentation from a chest CT scan using 3D Slicer and the TotalSegmentator extension.</p>
<p>I successfully segmented the trachea and main bronchi, but the result is currently limited to generation 1–2 only. I would like to obtain a more detailed airway tree, ideally reaching generation 4 or 5, if the image resolution allows it.</p>
<p>Are there <strong>specific parameters or presets</strong> in TotalSegmentator that can help recover more distal airway generations?</p>
<p>Thank you very much for your help and for the amazing work on Slicer and TotalSegmentator.</p>
