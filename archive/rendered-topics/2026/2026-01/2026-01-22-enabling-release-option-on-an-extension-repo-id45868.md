<p>I need make a release for a publication purposes. By default we disable the release option in any Slicer extension repository. Would enabling it break something?</p>

<p>It shouldn’t! You should be good to enable it.</p>

<p>We only recommend to disable Releases for an extension’s github repository if Releases are not used (just to reduce noise).</p>
