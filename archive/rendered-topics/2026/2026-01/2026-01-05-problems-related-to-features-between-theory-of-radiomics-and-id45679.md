<p>Hi, I’m the new using PyRadiomics just after three months. So I’m probably confused about the number of features can be extracted and calculated using PyRadiomics. On the official web of PyRadiomics there are 110 features that can do things i just said. But when I do it with my partner, there are seemly 88 features which compatible with theory of Radiomics. So how about the 22 features then, where do they come from and go.</p>
<p>P/s: I’m now a third-year student at Science University in Viet Nam, I do be excited about this topic related to PyRadiomics, by that I hope somebody can help me with that question. I’m very appreciate about that. Thanks a lot</p>
