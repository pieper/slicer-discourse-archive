<p>Good evening,</p>
<p>I am a student working on a research project and need assistance calculating volumes of bone samples using 3D Slicer. I have surface models (PLY files) for approximately 40 samples.</p>
<p>Due to time constraints, I am looking for someone with experience in Slicer who would be willing to calculate these volumes on my behalf. I can provide all files and any required details, and I am happy to compensate for your time.</p>
<p>If this is something you would be interested in, please reply or message me and I can share additional information.</p>
<p>Thank you for your consideration.</p>
