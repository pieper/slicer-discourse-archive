<p>Dear support,</p>
<p>is it possible to directly export segmentation 3d model from slicer in usdz format?</p>

<p>We don’t currently have that.  USD support is on the radar and should be pretty straightforward if someone wants to dig in with a little programming.  It’s possible that a chatbot could get most of the way.</p>
