<p>I am pleased to share the Atlas I created using the Dense Correspondence Analysis (DeCA) tool for 3D surfaces with anyone interested in craniofacial imaging. This set of 19 .mrd files, spanning from 0 days to adulthood, was created from  CT scans of 184 normal people. The models are oriented according to the vestibular orientation. My purpose was to superimpose an age-matched shape model onto 3D imaging of craniofacial malformations for better analysis and understanding of those malformations.</p>
<p>If you are interested, you can download a folder containing a subfolder with the 19 .mrb files and some complementary files that help explain how to use the Statistical Shape Models.</p>
<p>A special acknowledgement <span class="mention">@Murat</span> Maga for his help.</p>
<p>This is the link to download the folder.  <a href="https://zenodo.org/records/18348475" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Atlas of Growing Human Skull Statistical Shape Models In Vestibular Orientation.</a></p>
