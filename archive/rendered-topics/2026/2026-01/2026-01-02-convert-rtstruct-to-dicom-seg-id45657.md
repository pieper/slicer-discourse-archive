<p>You can load the RTStruct in Slicer if you have the SlicerRT extension installed. Then as far as I know you can export it to DICOM SEG if the QuantitativeReporting extension is installed, but I have never done this myself. See detailed information on DICOM exporting here: <a href="https://slicer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/modules/dicom.html#export-data-from-the-scene-to-dicom-database" class="inline-onebox">DICOM — 3D Slicer documentation</a></p>
