<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am working on some voxel plots comparing a segmented PET region’s SUV values over multiple time points. When I use the segment statistics feature within slicer, I get SUV min/max/average values that match my clinical data. When I export the SUV values using a labelmap and graph them, I am seeing values nearly double that of their known voxel values. Is there some way I need to transfer the SUV calculation parameters so that I can get this data to match? If anyone can offer suggestions, I would greatly appreciate it.</p>
