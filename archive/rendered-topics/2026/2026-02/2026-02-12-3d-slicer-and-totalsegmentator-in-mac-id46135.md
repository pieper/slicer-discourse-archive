<p>I have installed 3d slicer 5. 10 in mac mini. I also installed laterest totalsegmentator using slicer extension. But when I apply the error message torch not found occur. Is there something I should take note when using slicer and totalsegmentator in mac OS?</p>

<p>We have updated TotalSegmentator this week and will make pytorch installation more robust next week, so please try again. You can check the status of pytorch (and reinstall it, if its import fails), using <code>PyTorch Utils</code> module.</p>
