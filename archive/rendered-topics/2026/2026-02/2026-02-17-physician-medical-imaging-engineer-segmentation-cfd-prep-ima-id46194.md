<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>I’m Noor , a physician with a background in neurology and clinical imaging, and over the past few years I’ve built a parallel focus in medical image processing and 3D reconstruction.</p>
<p>I work at the intersection of clinical medicine and technical imaging, which means I understand not just how to process a scan, but what the output actually needs to look like to be medically meaningful. That combination tends to make a difference in the final result.</p>
<p>Most of my work falls into a few areas:</p>
<p>— Segmentation of complex anatomical structures (brain, vasculature, tumors) from CT/MRI data<br>
— Preparing 3D models for CFD analysis, including mesh cleanup, capping, and solver-ready geometry<br>
— Building AI/ML pipelines for medical image analysis and automated segmentation<br>
— Custom 3D Slicer workflows and scripting for research or clinical workflows</p>
<p>I’ve worked on projects ranging from glioblastoma surgical planning tools to vascular CFD prep to radiation dose optimization, so I’m comfortable with both the segmentation side and what happens downstream.</p>
<p>If you’re working on something and hitting a wall, or need someone to handle the technical side of a project, feel free to DM me. Happy to have a conversation about what you’re trying to do.</p>
