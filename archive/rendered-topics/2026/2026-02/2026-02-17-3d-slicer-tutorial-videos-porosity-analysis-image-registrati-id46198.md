<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>I’ve started a YouTube tutorial series focused on practical workflows in <strong>3D Slicer</strong>, and I’d love to share it with the community here.</p>
<p>So far, the videos cover topics such as:<br>
• Porosity analysis workflows<br>
• Image registration techniques<br>
• …More to come…</p>
<p>My goal is to create clear, hands-on tutorials that help users apply Slicer to real projects. I also have more topics planned and would be happy to take suggestions on what would be most useful.</p>
<p>If you’re interested, you can check out the videos here:<br>

<p>Feedback, questions, and topic requests are very welcome — I hope the tutorials are helpful!</p>

<p>These are great, thank you for working on this!</p>
<p>A tiny feedback: you added the old Slicer logo in the videos, but we have a new logo, which you can access for example <a href="https://github.com/Slicer/Slicer/tree/main/Applications/SlicerApp/Resources/Images">here</a></p>
