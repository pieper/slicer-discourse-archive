<p>Hello all,</p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">I have a logical question regarding the slider increments and their relation to let’s say my PC1 axis.</span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">I did 2D morphometric analysis in other programs (Thin plate spline)  and let’s say my sample with highest PC1 score is 0.3, I can extrapolate the deformation 2x or more times (called extrapolation coefficient, if I am not mistaken), which would result in the PC1 score 0.6 for my extrapolated shape. Is it possible to get an extrapolation coefficient from the slider value?  </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-GB">I understand that when selecting PC1 and starting on the position 0 on the slider that this is the mean shape. But when I increase the slider to 100 in the positive direction along the PC1 where would be the data point on my PC1 axis?</span></p>

<p>Magnification factor is now implemented in the GPA module. Make sure you are using the latest stable (v5.10).</p>
