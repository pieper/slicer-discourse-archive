<p>There are some technical terms, not particular to any field, that upon translation come out as nonsensical due to that term not being used in the translated version.</p>
<p>I’ll give one example, but I’ve come across others. Image registration comes out as “transformation between two images for them to be spatially correspondent“, whereas “registo de imagens“ is used to register an image for copyright purposes in Portuguese.</p>
<p>Do I keep the original term, or do I adapt it to where the translation isn’t direct, but makes the point come across? Which in this case would be more on the likes of “alinhamento de imagens“, or image alignment.</p>

<p>Please use the term that is used for medical image registration. You can make the change directly in <a href="https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/3d-slicer/3d-slicer/">Weblate - the site where Slicer translations are managed</a>. You can find guidelines for the translation in the <a href="https://github.com/SoniaPujolLab/SlicerLanguagePacks?tab=readme-ov-file#documentation">LanguagePacks extension documentation</a>. Thanks in advance for your contribution!</p>
