<p>Problem report for Slicer 5.7.0-2024-04-25 win-amd64</p>
<p>Good afternoon I installed my license on my third computer with Windows 11. The 3dSlicer segmentation is loading but does not finish. It keeps loading… As shown in the screenshot below. Can you help me?</p>

<p>Please download and install the latest Slicer Stable Release or latest Slicer Preview Release and let us know if something still does not work as expected.</p>
