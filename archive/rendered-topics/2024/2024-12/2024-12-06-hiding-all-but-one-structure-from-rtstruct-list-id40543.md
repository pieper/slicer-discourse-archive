<p>Using the “eye” icons one can hide all structures or individual structures. However, if I want to view one or two structures in isolation I need to manually hide all the structures I don’t want to see, which can be quite time consuming. Is there a better way to do this?</p>

<p>Typically you can select a range (shift-click) and then right click to get the context menu and select Toggle visibility.</p>

<p>There is a “Show only this segment” option when you right-click the eye icon in the row of a segment.</p>
