<p>Hi, all<br>
I saw there were some codes using qWarning() in Slicer source code. If I don’t build Slicer from source code, I installed the stable version which is download from the website. Is it possible to see the message from qWaring() if some settings in the Slicer are changed? Or using the python scripts? As far as I know, an environment variable QT_FATAL_WARNINGS can controls the message level from qWarning().</p>
