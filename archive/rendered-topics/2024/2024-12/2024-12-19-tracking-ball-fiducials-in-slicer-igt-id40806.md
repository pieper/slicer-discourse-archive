<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have been working on tracking fiducials for a while, and have managed to run the ArUco tracking with Plus Server successfully.  However, we would like to be able to track instruments with standard navigation arrays, with balls on each point.  Is there a good way to track something like this using a similar set up, with 3D slicer?</p>
<p>Thank you for your time.</p>
