<p>Operating system: Windows10<br>
Slicer version: 5.7.0-1206<br>
Expected behavior: Contributing to Improved alignment accuracy<br>
Actual behavior: I can`t see the nemerical values because i only have vector images.</p>
<p>I would like to know how to interpret the vector values when two image are superimposed using a nonrigid transformation.</p>

<p>Do you mean you have vector volumes?  Maybe include a screenshot or describe what the vector volumes represent.  Do you want to see the values in the Data Probe or somewhere else?</p>

<p>Transformation displacement vector values at the current mouse pointer position are shown in Transforms module’s Information section.</p>
