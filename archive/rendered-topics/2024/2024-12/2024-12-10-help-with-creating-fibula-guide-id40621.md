<p>Hey, I’m using slicer to create surgical guide for mandible reconstruction. I’m using version 5.6.2 for Mac.<br>
When creating points for fiducial list on a surgical guide these points always place themselves far from the surface of the guide (they’re hanging in air). Is there a way to make them only pin on a solid surface?<br>
Thanks for answers!</p>
