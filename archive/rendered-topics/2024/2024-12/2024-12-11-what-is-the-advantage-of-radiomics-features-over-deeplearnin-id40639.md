<p>Dear Slicer Community,</p>
<p>I have a general question and I don’t quite understand why you want to use radiomics, because I would have said that a neural network also extracts features based on the structure of the radiological image?<br>
To me it feels more like handcarfted features. How do you see it ?</p>
<p>Best regards<br>
