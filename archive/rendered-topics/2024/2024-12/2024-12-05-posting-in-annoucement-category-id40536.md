<p>I started creating a message in announcement category, but then somehow it ended up being sent to review. I haven’t finished it yet, and I cannot find a way to retract to edit.</p>
<p>Can one of the admins help me? <a class="mention" href="/u/jcfr">@jcfr</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/lassoan">@lassoan</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/pieper">@pieper</a></p>

<p>“Announcements” is a special category because by default the first post of each new topic is sent to all forum members (10,000+ people) as an email. Therefore, every post in this category gets into the review queue.</p>
<p>About this specific post: I’ve rejected the post so that <a class="mention" href="/u/muratmaga">@muratmaga</a> can revise/repost it. It is partly a great success story, partly a good discussion starter about using Slicer in the cloud, which is interesting for many people, but I’m not sure if Announcements category is the best fit. “Success stories” or “Community”, or maybe the default “Support” category might be be more appropriate. What do you think?</p>

<p>Thanks <a class="mention" href="/u/lassoan">@lassoan</a> I didn’t know Announcements mass emails people. Surely I don’t want to do that! I will change the category to community…</p>
