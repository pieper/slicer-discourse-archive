<p>Hi, I’m a student who uses a 3D Slicer.</p>
<p>I’m splitting certain muscles.<br>
But it takes too long to split this up.<br>
I’ve tried Volume Rendering, but it doesn’t seem to fix it here. And even if it does, it’s difficult.</p>
<p>Setting up -80 to 50 with Threshold creates too many noises, not just chest muscles, but also muscles in the skin, organ muscles, subcutaneous fat.</p>
<p>Is there a way to segment only the parts I want (thoracic and shoulder muscles, back muscles)?</p>
<p>The same method as the module is good, and suggest many methods.<br>
Thank!</p>
