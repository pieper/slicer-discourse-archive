<p>Help anyone, I am currently using the Pediclescrewsimulator extension to insert screws into the spine with a particular length and trajectory. When I load the CT scan with the pediclescrewsimulator module, the space origin (coordinates) immidiately changes. This is a big problem because when I try to match this with the annotated data of the spine (Same CT) they have completely different space origins. Does anyone maybe know how to use the pediclescrewsimulator but without changing the original space origin coordinates of the CT?</p>
<p>I am not good at python but maybe there is a code that can help fix this problem? (keep the original coordinates of the file after switching to pediclescrew simulator module)</p>
<p>Thanks a lot for your response.</p>
