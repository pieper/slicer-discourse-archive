<p>Greetings, first of all I am new to the 3D slicer I just got to know about the basics of segmentation. I have segmented the carotid artery now I want to make the blood flow passage by labelling inlet and outlet how to do that in vmtk using python and what are the software to be installed so that I can use them in COMSOL simulation. If anybody know please reply me it will be helpful for my project</p>
