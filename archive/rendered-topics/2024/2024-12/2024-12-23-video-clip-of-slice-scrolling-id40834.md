<p>would be amazing if its possible to export recording of slice scrolling .<br>
i like this instead of needing to save multiple slices .</p>

<p>I think this could be done using the ScreenCapture module. Please check it out<br>

<p>Try using the GUI of the module first, if those features are not enough then you’ll need to write a small python script</p>
