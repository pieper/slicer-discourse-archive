<p>I used the ‘lung ct segmenter’ extension to first segment the lung region and the result is used as the preprocessing result. However, I dont know the specific  method that the extension used or the network was used. and now I need to cite the preprocessing procedure, plz tell me what network was used or how shold i cite. FYI, I didnot click the ‘use AI’ box.<br>
Many thanks!<a class="mention" href="/u/rbumm">@rbumm</a></p>
