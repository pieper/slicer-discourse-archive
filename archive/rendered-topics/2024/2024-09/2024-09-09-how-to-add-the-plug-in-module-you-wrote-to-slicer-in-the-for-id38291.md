<p>Now I have encountered a new difficulty: I wrote a plug-in myself and put the .py file and .ui file in a folder, but I don’t know how to import this plug-in module into slicer. Is there any way to implement it in the code or command line? I urgently need your help, thank you.<br>
I currently only know that I can manually add the module path in Edit-&gt;Application Settings-&gt;Modules in slicer, but I want to know if there are other ways.</p>
