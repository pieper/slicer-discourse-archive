<p>Hello <a class="mention" href="/u/jcfr">@jcfr</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/lucasgandel">@LucasGandel</a></p>
<p>I checked if SLICER VR was compatible with an HTC VIVE FOCUS 3<br>
(connected by USB-C to a desktop using VIVE BUSINESS STREAMING software<br>
and STEAM VR), but it is not mentionned on GITHUB.</p>
<p>By any chance is it something you are planning to make compatible?</p>
<p>Many thanks</p>

<p>Have you tried using the OpenXR backend with the latest Slicer preview version (5.7.0)? It may support the latest devices.</p>
<p>I see VTK commits from time to time about VR, but not in SlicerVR, and honestly I have no idea about plans or progress in general. I hope VR will be fully usable in Slicer soon.</p>

<p>Yes, all new VR/AR headsets should work well via OpenXR. I’ve tried a Meta Quest 3 last week and all basic features (rendering, moving, resetting view position, grabbing to move objects) worked.</p>
<p>It would be nice to fix/complete implementation of laser picking, two-handed gestures, passthrough AR, simpler clipping, markups moving, GUI widgets, etc. SlicerHeart project is interested and may dedicate funding to some of these.</p>

<p>Hi <a class="mention" href="/u/cpinter">@cpinter</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/lassoan">@lassoan</a> ,<br>
Thank you for your feedback. I tried with slicer 5.7 and indeed, it is working in VR with this version <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"><br>
Thanks for your support !</p>

<p>Hi, my meta quest 3 does not connect with the slicer. It always says " connection failed" How do I overcome this? Thank you. Jan</p>
