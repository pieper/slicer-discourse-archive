<p>Hello, I have recently been having some issues with my work and Slicer, and I hope I can find a solution here. I am currently using version 5.6.1 of Slicer. The issues are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>I have 185 segments that I can export to models and then save each one in the different formats the program provides. The problem arises when I want to export them directly to another folder using “Export as.” When I try to export them in OBJ, they always export as a single file, even though I have that option disabled. When I export them in STL, only 157 out of the 185 get exported to the destination folder. Related to this issue, when I try to export one of the segments that didn’t get exported as a model, and I select to export only the visible segments as STL, nothing gets exported to the destination folder.</li>
<li>The second problem occurs when I want to take a screenshot using the icons where the camera appears. When I press the 3D view, it appears distorted by default or doesn’t appear at all, and when I click “save as,” nothing gets saved in the destination folder.</li>
</ol>
<p>Thank you so much for your time,</p>
<p>Jared.</p>
