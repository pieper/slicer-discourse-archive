<p>Hi, i would like to start a project about lung analysis. The idea is to do autosegmentation for CT scans with 3D slicer and build a machine learning or deep learning model.  for autosegmentation part, what are the recommended extensions ? i have gone through lung CT analyzer, Lung GGM segmenter, Lung segmenter, monai3DautoSeg.</p>
