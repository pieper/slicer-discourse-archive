<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have a qDess and a T2-mapping data set that both contain multiple echoes for each scan, and I was wondering if there is a way to export all the echoes after performing image registration within Slicer.</p>
<p>At the moment I seem to only be able to save the first echo.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>
