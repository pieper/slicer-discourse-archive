<p>Hello. I have 3 questions.</p>
<ol>
<li>I want to open three MRI sequences and synchronizing them in 3D Slicer. For example when I move among slides of T2W, this movement should happen for other sequences as well.</li>
<li>In addition I need to rotate or flip  one of my sequences, how can I do it?</li>
<li>Can I do segmentation for different sequences and save them separately? Thank you in advance.</li>
</ol>
