<p>Dear Support,</p>
<p>I am currently working on a project about Primary Spontaneous Pneumothorax (PSP) in patients (Pneumotrial), and I am looking into analyzing pre-operative CT images of these patients. I would like to know if the CT analyzer extension would be able to also “find” the collapses part of the lung. Other pathologies that I would like to investigate are the presence of Bullae/blebs (small air-filled sacs) in the lungs, would the CT analyzer be able to do this too?.</p>
