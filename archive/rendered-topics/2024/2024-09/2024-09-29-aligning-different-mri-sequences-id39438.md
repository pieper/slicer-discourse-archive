<p>Hello. I have different MRI sequences of each patient in nifti format (T2W, DWI, and ADC). T2W and ADC are in the same direction, but I have to rotate DWI in 180 degrees. I did it by Transforms module and saved the rotated image but when I open these three sequences together, the DWI is not aligned with others and when I want ti link them , one of them disappear (when I click on adjust icon the other one disappear). I need to link these three sequences and check them in parallel, but because of these problems I can not, please help me to solve the problem.</p>
