<p>Dear Slicer Community,</p>
<p>As many of you know, the 3D Slicer Community and the SOFA community are collaboratively working on the SlicerSOFA extension. This addition allows you to integrate the simulation capabilities of the SOFA Framework directly into your Slicer workflows. As many of you know, SOFA is an open-source framework designed for interactive mechanical simulations, particularly in biomechanics and robotics. This new extension presents a fantastic opportunity for collaboration between the SOFA and Slicer communities!</p>
<p>To foster such collaborations, the SOFA community organizes an annual event: SOFA Week. This year, it will be held in Lille, France, from November 25th to 29th. A highlight of the week is the one-day conference on Tuesday, November 26th, where researchers and industry professionals come together to share their ideas, experiences, and showcase ongoing projects or products developed using SOFA. The event will feature multiple presentation sessions on various simulation topics and applications, as well as booths for technology demonstrations.</p>
<p>We warmly invite you all to join and connect with the SOFA community! Registration is free and can be done here: <a href="https://www.sofa-framework.org/sofa-events/sofa-week-2024/registration/" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">SOFA – Registration</a></p>
<p>Looking forward to seeing many of you there!</p>
<p>Open-sourcely yours,<br>
The SOFA Development Team</p>
