<p>New to this forum, but not to Slicer. Impressed by the diversity of applications<br>
I am looking for a software package capable of “redressing” the (CT) image of the spine in such a way that it follows a straight axis. I think such software was part of (some) radiology workstations, but I can’t put my hand on it. I was thinking of an elastic coregistration with a model of a straight spine (possibly with fiducial markers, like reference points). Any help?? Thank you  WJP medmax</p>

<p>This straightening operation is called “Curved planar reformat” and it is available in the <a href="https://github.com/PerkLab/SlicerSandbox?tab=readme-ov-file#curved-planar-reformat">“Curved planar reformat” module in Sandbox extension</a>.</p>

<p>Thank you ++<br>
I expect you are referring to the Sandbox extension of Slicer?  I must check whether I have this extension on my version<br>
Have a good day<br>

<p>Yes, you can install the Sandbox extension from the Extensions Manager. It is available for current version of Slicer on all operating systems.</p>
