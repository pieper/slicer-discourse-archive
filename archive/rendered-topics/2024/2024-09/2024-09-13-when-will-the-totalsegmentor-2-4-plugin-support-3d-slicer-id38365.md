<p>Current Slicer release (latest Slicer Stable Release and latest Slicer Preview Release) uses the very latest TotalSegmentator (2.4.0 with patches up to 2024 September).</p>
<p>Make sure you have the latest Slicer application installed and TotalSegmentator extension in the Extensions Manager is up-to-date.</p>
