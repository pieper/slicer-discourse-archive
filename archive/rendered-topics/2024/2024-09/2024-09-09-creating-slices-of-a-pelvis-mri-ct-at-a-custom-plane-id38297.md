<p>Hello, we are trying to create some slice images of a pelvis MRI/CT. Because it’s beyond our skill level, we would like to pay someone (on a freelance basis) to help us with this. Please let me know if you are interested.</p>
<p>My goal is to generate images of the pelvis at certain cross-sections other than sagittal/axial/coronal. Additionally, I need a way to look at these images and figure out where we are. If the images could be automatically labeled with the anatomy parts (e.g. “obturator internus”, “bladder”), that would be ideal. We could either use a publicly available DICOM of a male pelvis MRI/CT, or I could provide you with one. (Maybe there are some publicly available MRIs that have already been segmented and labeled?)</p>
<p>The reason for this project is we have ultrasound images taken at various specific angles that are challenging to interpret, so we would like to be able to compare them to reference images from an MRI or CT (or even a 3D model as found in anatomy apps).</p>
<p>Again, this is beyond my skill level, so please let me know if you’d be interested. You can contact me here or at <a href="mailto:chris36103pub@gmail.com">chris36103pub@gmail.com</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
