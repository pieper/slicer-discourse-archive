<p>Kitware will be holding two online 3D Slicer training courses:</p>
<h3><a name="p-116394-october-11-3d-slicer-for-usershttpswwwkitwareeu3d-slicer-training-1" class="anchor" href="#p-116394-october-11-3d-slicer-for-usershttpswwwkitwareeu3d-slicer-training-1" aria-label="Heading link"></a>October 11: <a href="https://www.kitware.eu/3d-slicer-training/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">3D Slicer for Users</a></h3>
<p>This course is designed for users who want to get familiar with 3D Slicer. You’ll learn how to navigate the interface, load and manipulate datasets, annotate images, and save your work. The course also includes an introduction to creating your own modules and plugins using Python.</p>
<h3><a name="p-116394-october-14-3d-slicer-for-developershttpswwwkitwareeuslicer-for-developers-training-2" class="anchor" href="#p-116394-october-14-3d-slicer-for-developershttpswwwkitwareeuslicer-for-developers-training-2" aria-label="Heading link"></a>October 14: <a href="https://www.kitware.eu/slicer-for-developers-training/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">3D Slicer for Developers</a></h3>
<p>The goal of this training is to give developers a good understanding of the core concepts and tools of Slicer that are needed to start developing custom solutions and extend Slicer capabilities.</p>
