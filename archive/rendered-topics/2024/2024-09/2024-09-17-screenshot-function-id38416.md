<p>Hi there !<br>
After some Registration I wanted to export some single pictures in the JPEG or PNG or TIF format. I´m using the Version 5.0.3. There used to be a Camera-Icon on the taskbar on top with this function on earlier versions but I couldn´t find it anymore. I tried to export the images via the “Save function” in the JPEG or PNG format but I got an error-message for that and it didn´t work out.</p>
<p>Has someone an advice?<br>
Best regards<br>
Jan</p>

<p>please try with the latest stable 5.6.2. Version you use is over two years old and is not maintained.</p>
