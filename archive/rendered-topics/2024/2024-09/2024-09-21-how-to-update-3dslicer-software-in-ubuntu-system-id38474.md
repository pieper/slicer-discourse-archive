<p>Dear teachers, I have been using the ubuntu system to run our 3Dslicer software. Considering that the version is old and I cannot experience the new functions well, I recently want to upgrade the 3Dslicer software to the latest version without destroying the original configuration. . Since I’m not very good at the ubuntu system, I don’t know how to upgrade. Again, I would like to ask you about the relevant process of updating the 3Dslicer software.<br>
grateful</p>

<p>What version of ubuntu are you running? You may have to install some libraries, please see the system requirements for Linux from this link: <a href="https://slicer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/getting_started.html#linux" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Getting Started — 3D Slicer documentation</a></p>
<p>There is no <strong>update</strong>, you just download the new version of Slicer from <a href="http://download.slicer.org" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">download.slicer.org</a>, uncompress the archive, and start using that version. You can have many versions of slicer as you need/want on the same computer.</p>
