<p>Hi</p>
<p>I am following some of the featured tutorials from your site and a lot of the youtube videos show a “MakeModelEffect” button in the editor. I could not find it in my version but I did find “Show 3D” button, which has the some icon as the MakeModelEffect. I can export stl from segmentation module but I wanted to see the vtk. I finally managed to figure it out by changing output type to model in the segmentation module but I wanted to make sure since it is a bit confusing to navigate it on my own. If you can provide or share a more recent tutorial for newer versions, I would appreciate it.</p>

<p>This is from a very old version of Slicer.  We can’t control what shows up on youtube, but you can always start from <a href="http://slicer.org">slicer.org</a> where you’ll find the latest versions of the code and corresponding documentation.</p>
