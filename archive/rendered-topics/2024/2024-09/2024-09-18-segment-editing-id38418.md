<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am having some trouble segment editing my scan. Is there something I must do before I begin using the editing tools? Under the Segment edit module, when I select the file title, click “add”, and use the erase tool for example, I then try to erase apart of the scan and nothing changes.<br>
Let me know if you have any tips. Thank you!</p>

<p>it is not clear what’s happening from your description. Possibly incorrect Masking settings or a threshold. Please make yourself familiar with the segment editor by reading the user manual and following this tutorial</p>

      <pre><code class="lang-md"># Introduction to Image Segmentation with 3D Slicer
Segmentation is one of the most useful things you can do with Slicer! A segmentation is an abstract representation of structures in an image. It usually contains more than one segment (usually non-overlapping) annotated with different colors in 2D and 3D.

&lt;p align="center"&gt;
&lt;img src="images/turtle_seg.gif"&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

In Slicer, there two complementary modules that are used hand-in-hand for segmentation tasks.

1. `Segment Editor` is the module for creating segmentations of volumes. Segmentation (also known as contouring) delineate structures of interest. There are various manual and semiautomatic methods for generating your segmentations which we cover in the tutorial below.  
2. `Segmentations` is the module that allows you to control how the segmentations generated by `Segment Editor` are saved and exported. Some of the key functionality is to import/export segmentations into **LabelMap** or **3D Model** representations, adjust and edit display properties, copy/move segments across different segmentations, and so forth. 

------

If you are new to image segmentation, it is a good ideas to read the [official **Image Segmentation** documentation from 3D Slicer.](https://slicer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/image_segmentation.html) Even if you have previous experience with other 3D segmentation programs, it might be good to take a minute to read the Slicer specific functionalities and how different types of data types relate to each other (see figure below).

<p>Based on the description what occurs to me is that you may want to use the segment editor incorrectly. It cannot edit the anatomical image (e.g. CT), but you can delinate structures on it, i.e. add segments on top of the CT. In other words, you cannot use the eraser without painting something first. I suggest you look at the segmentation tutorial:</p>

<p>I wish to know what is your point of view concerning this looong enterprise disclaimer message.</p>
<p>Mine is that it is disturbing in a public forum, does not represent any interest in a forum and does not convey anything.</p>
<p>Of course, people will always add one if they want to. I think that the general rules of conduct should declare that disclaimers having meaning for a company and that does not directly imply the user in a topic or Slicer itself should be avoided.</p>
<p>I wanted to tell this to <span class="mention">@Lee_Fei</span> in a private message, but he is tagged with ‘This user is no longer active.’ !!!</p>

<p>I am not sure if this is the case, but these might get added to the email not by the sender, but the institutional email server, and often user have no control over that, I know my institution does it for emails to external addresses.</p>
<p>Perhaps discourse has a way to filter signatures and these kinds of addendums.</p>
