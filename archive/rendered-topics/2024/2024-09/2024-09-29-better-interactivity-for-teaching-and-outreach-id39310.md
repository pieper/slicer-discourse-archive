<p>Using <a href="https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/komodo-dragon-skull-anatomy-b4b2ef32f8714c7983153ee5741c5778" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">this model</a> as a demonstration, I am wondering what is necessary to implement such functionality (such as camera rotating to the specific segment, when clicked on the number).</p>
<p>Would it be possible to published them like that (outside of Slicer?)</p>

<p>I’m sure it’s very feasible to make Slicer behave like that with a fairly simple script (associate markup points with segments and decide how you want the camera to behave when you click on a point).  It would just take someone doing a bit of investigation and coding.  As for exporting, probably you would need to pick a viewer app and customize it.  I doubt there’s an existing standard for this behavior.</p>

<p>There is some imperfect infrastructure in the scenesnapshot functionality that might be helpful for such a project.</p>
