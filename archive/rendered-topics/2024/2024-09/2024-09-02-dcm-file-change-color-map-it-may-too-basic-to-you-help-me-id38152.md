<p>I know this question can be very basic and cumbersome.<br>
But using 3d slicer in windows, I’m having a lot of trouble trying to convert the surface changes to color maps.</p>
<p>I converted dcm files to stl file.<br>
and I want to make a color map in surface change.</p>
<p>I would like to know if there is any way to convert stl file to vtk file.<br>
Lots of guideline tell us it begins with vtk file.<br>
but I cannor find a way to make vtk files.</p>
<p>Please tell me how to change dcm file to vtk file.</p>
<p>Your answers will be of great help to my research.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
