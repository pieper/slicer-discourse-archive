<p>I am running the segmentation on a CPU and when ever I run total segmentator, and it gives me the option to run it on “fast mode” or “full resolution”, I choose full resolution but it still runs in fast mode. During the segmentation it tells me this</p>
<p>“No GPU detected. Running on CPU. This can be very slow. The ‘–fast’ or the <code>--roi_subset</code> option can help to reduce runtime.<br>
Using ‘fast’ option: resampling to lower resolution (3mm)<br>
Resampling…”</p>
<p>How can I fix this?</p>
