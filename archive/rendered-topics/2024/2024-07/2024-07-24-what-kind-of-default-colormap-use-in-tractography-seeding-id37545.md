<p>Operating system:win 11<br>
Slicer version:5.4.0<br>
Expected behavior:<br>
Actual behavior:<br>
I was wondering what type of colormap was used in tractography seeding, which was user-defined when I debuging use vs2019, but I couldn’t find the definition</p>

<p>You can explore the color mappings in the Tractography Display module in SlicerDMRI.  By default it’s some kind of rainbow of FA scalars IIRC.</p>
