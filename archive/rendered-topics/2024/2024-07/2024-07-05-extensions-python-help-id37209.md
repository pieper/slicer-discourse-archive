<p>As a programming beginner who has just learned python, I am very interested in the project of 3d slicer. I want to develop a python plug-in to realize the extraction function of shape in radiomic with a simple ui interface, but I have no way to start. I can’t find a tutorial on making python plugins. I hope you can get help.<br>
I found a github project(<a href="https://github.com/lassoan/SlicerSimpleWorkflows" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">GitHub - lassoan/SlicerSimpleWorkflows: Examples of simple application-specific workflows implemented using 3D Slicer</a>), but it doesn’t agree with my needs. I hope someone has a similar project for reference.</p>
