<p>i wish i can export segments in STL / obj directly  without converting to models then exporting .<br>
i think many of user would love to export to print to visualize without any work inside slicer.<br>
i know it is simple to convert then export  but i think it would be much  better  otherwise</p>

<p>I wouldn’t call a single-click more work inside slicer, but then…</p>
<p>What you are asking for is  already available. Go to <code>Segmentations</code> module, scroll down to find the <strong>Import/Export</strong> and below that you will find the menu to export segmentations to STL/OBJ directly to the disk.</p>

<p>i mean that im not doing any editing for the models inside slicer , and yeah i agree but i do plenty of exporting models that why it came to my mind.</p>
<p>actually the way you pointed actually export much faster for some reason .</p>
