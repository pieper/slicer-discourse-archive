<p>amass desont work well . no idea why i just could make it work. dental segmentator is miracle . works perfect . but have some issues with certain volumes . tried them with MONA and it works fine .</p>
<p>so im hoping mona can add teeth model so we can have options in case other modules run into issues .</p>
