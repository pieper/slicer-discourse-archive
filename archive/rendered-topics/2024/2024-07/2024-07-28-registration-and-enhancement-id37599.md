<p>How are you everyone hope you all are good i need help please i’m recently install a 3D slicer and need to ask some question. First my research point related to both medical imaging and deep learning so my supervisor asked me to work on SRS technique in radiation therapy and i get about 80 patient every one have planning CT which is high quality to calculate the dose on it on another side there are CBCT images which taken before session and it has a poor quality to calculate my dose on it so my point focus on how to apply enhancement on CBCT images and creat synthetic CT from CBCT… So i need someone guide me in 3D slicer to make a deformable registration between CBCT and pCT by the way i have a pCT and about 3 to 5 CBCT for every patient every CBCT series contains 93 images while pCT have fromm 90 to 200 images</p>
