<p>I want Python code to display angles on each screen. Means I want the change in angles while rotating the 3D view should be displayed on screen itself.</p>

<p>We will soon release a full-blown cathlab simulator (not just angle display but DRR generation, etc). Until then you can find a script that prints anatomical angles (RAO/LAO, CRA/CAU) in the corner of a 3D view in <a href="https://discourse.slicer.org/t/angles-measurement-in-3d-view/24435/3">this post</a>. There is also an ongoing discussion related to this <a href="https://discourse.slicer.org/t/optimal-c-arm-angulation-along-a-plane-from-ct/37200/9">here</a>.</p>
