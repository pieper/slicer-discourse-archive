<p>Hello everyone.<br>
As some of you may know, LTrace develops GeoSlicer in partnership with a major oil company in Brazil - PETROBRAS. The goal is to adapt 3D Slicer to analyze and process digital rock images.<br>
Last week we finally posted an open source version of the code on their github: <a href="https://github.com/petrobras/GeoSlicer" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">GitHub - petrobras/GeoSlicer</a><br>
This message is an acknowledgement of the great 3D Slicer community and brilliant developers that work hard to keep it stable and improve it everyday!<br>
Thank you!</p>
