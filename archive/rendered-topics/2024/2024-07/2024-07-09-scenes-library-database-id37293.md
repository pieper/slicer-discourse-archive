<p>You can export the scene into a DICOM file (by choosing to export the entire scene in the DICOM export dialog). After this the scene shows up in the DICOM browser. Does this fulfill your needs? Can you write a bit more about your use case?</p>

<p>it might , ill give it a shot<br>
but i meant having separate scene library to look up my work instead of browsing folder and opening scenes .</p>
<p>i do work on so 100+ of cases already and it would be great opening it from one place whenever i need .</p>
