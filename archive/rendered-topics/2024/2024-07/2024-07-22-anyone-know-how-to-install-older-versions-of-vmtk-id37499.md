<p>You can download VMTK 1.4 binaries from <a href="http://www.vmtk.org/download/">here</a>.</p>
<p>VMTK 1.2 was <a href="https://github.com/vmtk/vmtk/releases/tag/v1.2">released 10 years ago</a>. Maybe conda still has binaries but I’m not sure. The source code is available in github repository, so you can build it for sure, but you need to recreate an ancient development environment.</p>
