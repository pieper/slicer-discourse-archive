<p>Summary:<br>
I encountered an error while using the DentalSegmentator extension in 3D Slicer. When attempting to run the segmentation process, the following error message was displayed:<br>
“Failed to load the segmentation. Something went wrong during the nnUNet processing. Please check the log files for potential errors and contact the library maintainers.”</p>
<p>Steps to reproduce:<br>
Open 3D Slicer (version 5.7.0-2024-07-12) on Windows 11.<br>
Install and enable the DentalSegmentator extension.<br>
Import MRI files.<br>
Attempt to run the segmentation process.<br>
Observe the error message.</p>
<p>Expected behavior:<br>
The segmentation process should complete successfully, generating a 3D model from the MRI scans.</p>
<p>Actual behavior"<br>
The segmentation process fails with the error message:<br>
“Failed to load the segmentation. Something went wrong during the nnUNet processing. Please check the log files for potential errors and contact the library maintainers.”</p>
<p>Environment:<br>
Slicer version: Slicer-5.7.0-2024-07-12<br>
Operating system: Windows 11</p>
