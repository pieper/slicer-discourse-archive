<p>You can reach developers in the <a href="https://github.com/KitwareMedical/SlicerCBCTToothSegmentation/issues">repository’s issue tracker</a>. You will need to provide information about what did you do exactly, on what operating system, using what hardware (CPU, GPU, RAM, …), on what data, how did you get this error message, and post not just a selected message but the full log.</p>
