<p>Hi everyone, I’m Faikah and new to 3d slicer. I’m using 3d slicer version 5.61 for segmentation of my DICOM data. I faced a difficulties with how to normalized the data for preprocessing before my segmentation as I could not find how to modify the setting for normalization. My current output is ‘normalize’:false.,‘removeOutliers’:none.<br>
Thank you everyone for your help.</p>
