<p>Problem report for Slicer 5.6.2 win-amd64: HI Everyone! I am experiencing some problems with DrawTube function. The fiducials placement key is always disabled. (gray), therefore no fiducials can be placed to draw the tube. Both <em>SegmentEditorEXtraEffects</em> and <em>MarkupsToModels</em> extension are installed.<br>
Slicer Version is 5.6.2.</p>
<p>Any suggestion?</p>
<p>Thanks a lot in advance!</p>
