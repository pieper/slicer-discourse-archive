<p>Hello all,</p>
<p>I’m pretty new to 3D Slicer, and need some help with a project of mine. I have several DICOM volumes from MRI and I am trying to localize a fiducial marker that has a particular geometry. I have an STL of said fiducial marker, and I am wondering if there is a possibility of registering the STL directly to the DICOM file, or whether I would have to first find a way to convert the STL into a synthetic DICOM file.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
