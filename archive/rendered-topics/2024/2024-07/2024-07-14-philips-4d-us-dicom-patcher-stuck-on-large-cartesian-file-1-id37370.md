<p>Operating system:Win 11<br>
Slicer version:5.6.2<br>
Expected behavior: write the patched dicom, anonymized, of Qlab exported Dicom cartesian file that is 1.7GB<br>
Actual behavior: Ran for 10 hours and still did not write the file. Works almost instantly for other files from same case, as large as 480MB.</p>

<p>If the difference is just that the recording is longer, then the patcher may still work but you may need to wait more, or use a computer with much more RAM.</p>
<p>If you can share an anonymized file (anonymize this image or acquire a long recording on a phantom or a bucket of water) and share it with us (upload to dropbox/onedrive/google drive and post the link here) then we can investigate.</p>

<p>I tried the preview MAC version on a system with a lot more RAM and it works perfectly! thank you</p>
