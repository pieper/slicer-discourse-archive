<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I’m trying to configure Slicer settings for a system that will be accessed by multiple users during a study. Just like <a href="https://discourse.slicer.org/t/configure-slicer-settings-to-be-persistent/11921">this post</a> I would like to set the settings to be system-wide rather than just for a single user (e.g. setting default extension on launch, log file save location, etc). Is the suggestion on this post still the best approach?</p>
<p>Or is there a way to point the application startup script (.slicerrc.py file) to a common location instead of the user-specific location?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>
