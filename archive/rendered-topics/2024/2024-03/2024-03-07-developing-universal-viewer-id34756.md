<p>You don’t need any permission from anyone to do anything with Slicer. Most extensions come with restriction-free license, so you can do anything with those, too.</p>
<p>I know that all TotalSegmentator models that you can run without obtaining a license file, all MONAI Auto3DSeg, and OpenAnatomy are all freely usable, without telling anything anyone.</p>
<p>SegmentWithSAM, Segmentantbone, MEDSAM may be a bit immature.</p>
<p>I don’t know what you mean by VolView.</p>
