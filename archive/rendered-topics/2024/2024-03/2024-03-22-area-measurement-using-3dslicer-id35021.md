<p>I’m trying my best to use Polygon to mark the borders of Midbrain and Pons and then, calculate these areas. However, I didn’t find out.</p>
<p>The similar research “<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28150443/" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Manual MRI morphometry in Parkinsonian syndromes - PubMed</a>” in 2017 using 3D-Slicer with version 4.2.2.2-1 for Windows. I have attached a figure below to illustrate my point.</p>
<p>Would you please help me out? Thank you so much<br>
John</p>
