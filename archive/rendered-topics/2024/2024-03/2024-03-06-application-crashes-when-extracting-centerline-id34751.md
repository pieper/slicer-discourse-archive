<p>Unfortunatelly the forum won´t allow me to upload the mesh. i´ve analyzed it and found no clue as to why it fails, with some meshes it works smoothly<br>
I´m using the latest slicer stable release</p>

<p>You can upload the file anywhere (Dropbox, onedrive, Google drive, github,…) and post the link here.</p>
<p>Please test with latest Slicer Preview Release, too.</p>
