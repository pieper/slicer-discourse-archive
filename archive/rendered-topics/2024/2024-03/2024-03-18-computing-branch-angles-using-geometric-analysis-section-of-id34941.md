<p>Hello!</p>
<p>I am trying to compute the bifurcation angles along a pulmonary tree using VMTK. I have been ridiculously unsuccessful getting VMTK to install directly on macOS using either the binary installers or from source. I can get the extension to work very well in 3D Slicer, but the ‘geometric analysis’ feature is not included as a python wrapper. Does anyone have any suggestions on how to run this through the python interpreter in Slicer, another method, or how to get VMTK to run directly on data generated in slicer?</p>
