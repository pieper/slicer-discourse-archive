<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>Recently I meet a very strange problem when I save my data as mhd file.<br>
Sometimes it will save as a group of mhd file + raw file, which looks normal and correct. But sometimes it will save as a group of mhd file +zraw file, with a temporary file named TempWrite…</p>
<p>I tried with several version of 3D slicer (4.10.1 4.11 5.0.3), all of them have this kind of problem.<br>
I wonder if it is normal, and what’s the difference between zraw file and raw file?</p>
<p>Best,<br>
Chuan</p>

<p>I don’t use mhd and not very familiar, but I imagine zraw means compressed raw. So if you are having trouble, just uncheck compress option when you are saving the file.</p>
