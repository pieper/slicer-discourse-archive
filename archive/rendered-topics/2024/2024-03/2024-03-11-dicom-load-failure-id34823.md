<p>Operating system: win 11<br>
Slicer version: 5.4.0<br>
Expected behavior: loading dicom files<br>
Actual behavior: error occured while loading certain files</p>
<p>I am trying to load dicom files as usual by dragging and dropping and I got this message.  I tried to load dicom files and I tried add data widget and I have the same result every time.  the files are working on the millensys viewer which is the veiwer sent as a standard on the CD from the xray lab.</p>
<p>what to do</p>
