<p>when i installed a plugin from developer wizard,it showed a warningWARNING: The script jupyter-server.exe is installed in ‘D:\slicer\Slicer 5.6.1\lib\Python\Scripts’ which is not on PATH."i wonder what the “PATH refer to”,i tried the additional module path,it couldn‘t work either.I am long to know what is the “PATH”</p>
