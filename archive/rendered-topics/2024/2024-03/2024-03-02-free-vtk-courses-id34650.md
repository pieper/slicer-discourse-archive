<p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>i want to learn VTK in C++ but i found mostly outdated tutorial videos on the internet. Are there any free courses available for this?</p>
<p>I am a student and due to my some financial issues it is not possible for me to buy the official VTK course.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>If you are already comfortable with C++, then perhaps you can dive right into the VTK Examples and howtos?<br>
<a href="https://examples.vtk.org/site/CxxHowTo/" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://examples.vtk.org/site/CxxHowTo/</a></p>
<p>Did you look into them?</p>

<p>Yes <a class="mention" href="/u/muratmaga">@muratmaga</a>, i’ve already looked into the resources referenced in VTK’s site including the examples you mentioned above.</p>
<p>Perhaps a beginner level video based tutorial would make more sense.</p>
<p>Thanks for the link btw.</p>
