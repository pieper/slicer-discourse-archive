<p>Problem: I am trying to edit an CT using the segment editor and the paint feature in the editor. But when I go to paint, I can’t paint my wanted content on image. no trace was showed in the image. it can’t allowed me to edit.Does anyone know how to fix this problem?</p>

<p>Try with the SampleData and if that works then it’s possible you are hitting <a href="https://github.com/Slicer/Slicer/pull/7605">this issue</a>.  If that’s not it you can post your data for others to try.</p>
