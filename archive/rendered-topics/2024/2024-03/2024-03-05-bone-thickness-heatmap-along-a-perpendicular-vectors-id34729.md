<p>I am trying to create a thickness heatmap model of a segmented pelvis for preop planning of THA. The goal would be to create a heatmap showing the thickness where a screw could be placed. For this I figure I would need somehow to measure the distance between the inner and outer side of the model along a perpendicular vector to each surface.<br>
The problem I found with solutions show for craniectomy cases was that in the case of a pelvis I need the vectors to point outwards from the acetabulum, but with those methods i would get just the actual thickness of the model.</p>
<p>Do you have any suggestions?</p>
