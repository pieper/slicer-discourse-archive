<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I’m Ghazal, a Radiology Research Fellow at Johns Hopkins University. We’re embarking on a project that requires cardiac segmentation and are interested in using your Heart Automated Segmentation Tool which needs a license. Could you please provide details on this?</p>
<p>Thank you for your assistance.</p>
<p>Best,</p>
<p>Ghazal</p>
