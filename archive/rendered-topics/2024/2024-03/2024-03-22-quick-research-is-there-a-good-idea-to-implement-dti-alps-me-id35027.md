<p>Hello, Slicers!</p>
<p>I am currently doing a postdoc in the MRI image processing area, including DTI image processing. I found the DTI-ALPS index in recent papers, and it looked very promising for several applications.</p>
<p>In a quick search in the Slicer forum, I´ve found some discussion about the DTI-ALPS method and how to calculate it inside Slicer.<br>
As far as I know, it is not available a CLI/Python module that does the DTI-ALPS index, right?<br>
If it does exist, could someone share the module link with me?<br>
If it does not exist (yet), I would like to see if it is a good idea to implement it in the Slicer community.</p>
<p>Any thoughts are more than welcome!</p>
