<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am uploading stl files of aortas as I normally do to extract centerlines using the “Extract Centerline” module. However, when I go to first set the endpoints, I get the error shown above. Nothing looks wrong with my STL, so I am confused where this error is possibly stemming from. I have done this countless times before, and I have never gotten this error.<br>
