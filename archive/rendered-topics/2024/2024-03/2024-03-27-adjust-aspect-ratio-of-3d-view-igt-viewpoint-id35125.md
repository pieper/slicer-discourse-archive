<p>Hi,</p>
<p>For an augmented reality implementation i am using the Viewpoint-function of the IGT-Module.</p>
<p>I would like to adjust the aspect ratio of the 3D-View-Window, in which die viewpoint-perspective is displayed, so that the image (which is exported via webserver) has the same aspect ratio as the image of the real camera. How can this be done?</p>
<p>Thx in advance!</p>
