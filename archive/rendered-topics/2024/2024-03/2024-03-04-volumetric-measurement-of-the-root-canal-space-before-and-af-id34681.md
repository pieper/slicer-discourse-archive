<p>Operating system: MacOS 14.3.1<br>
Slicer version:5.6.1<br>
Expected behavior: defined volume of root canal space<br>
Actual behavior: sliced model of the tooth , but no separation for pulp space</p>
<p>Hi everyone,<br>
I am very new to the 3D Slicer, and I’m learnig my steps in using it.<br>
I’m conduting a scientific research to compare various irrigation and obturation techniques in endodontic treatment. To do that, I plan to compare root canal system volume with the obturation material volume and void spaces left. I have High resolution CBCT scans at the moment and in couple weeks I will have some micro-CT scans too.<br>
Is there a way of doing it in the 3D Slicer? Program has so many advanced options that I would appreciate any help and guidance.<br>
Is there en effective and relatively quick way of doing it?</p>
<p>Thanks<br>
Jacek</p>
