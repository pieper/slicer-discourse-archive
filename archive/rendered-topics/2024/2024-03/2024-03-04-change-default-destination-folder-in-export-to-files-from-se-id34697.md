<p>I am developing a tool that automatically opens a segmentation mask and the image in 3D Slicer so that the user can modify it. I do it by using --python-code option when executing slicer from terminal.</p>
<p>I would love to have all format options properly pre-established for better user experience. However, I could not find in the documentation where I can change them in the “Export to files” menu of the Segmentations module.</p>
<p>Thank you in advanced.</p>
