<p>I’ve created a spinal model and I’ve exported it as .stl, but I can’t visualize it when I try to import it in Adams</p>

<p>Can you visualize your model in other viewer such as <a href="https://3dviewer.net/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://3dviewer.net/</a> ?<br>
Just trying to make sure that the issue comes from the export.<br>
If the issue indeed comes from the export, can you explain how you exported it</p>
