<p>I have installed the extension SlicerVMTK and restarted slicer 3d.</p>
<p>This also happened to v5.7.0, v5.6.0, and v5.4.0 on Windows 10. So I installed the laterest version, v5.7.0-2024-04-19. But the error is the same.</p>
<p>I can use this extension to extract the centerline of the vessels but I cannot conduct the <strong>sectional analysis</strong>.</p>
<p>Python 3.9.10 (main, Apr 21 2024, 23:30:25) [MSC v.1938 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32</p>
