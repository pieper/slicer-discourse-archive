<p>Hello!<br>
I would like some help with blood vessels segmentation. I have tried several approaches, but I only get good results with big vessels. I can’t seem to properly segment the small vessels that surround organs, such as the pancreas or the inside the liver, and I need good resolution since it’s for surgical planning.<br>
Are there any strategies that work for you?<br>
Thank you!</p>
