<p>I installed 3Dslicer for windows. The Bitdefender immediately gave me notice as</p>
<p>The file C:\Users\nilab\AppData\Local\slicer.org\Slicer 5.6.2\lib\Slicer-5.6\CTKImageProcessingITKCorePythonQt.pyd is infected with Gen:Variant.Tedy.566536 and was moved to quarantine.</p>
<p>Why is it so? Is it safe to take the file back from quarantine?</p>
<p>Thanks and Regards<br>

<p>If you installed our binary version the most likely explanation is a false positive (search the forum for ‘virus false positive’ to see other examples).</p>
