<p>Hi I’m new to 3d slicer and VR. I’m trying to show 3d segmented brain on my HoloLens 2 using the extension SlicerVirtualReality using OpenXR backend and using holographic remote player on HoloLens 2 I try to connect it to my hololens2 it says “Receiving …”  but it says this for a undefined amount of time. Am I doing something wrong or does it take this long. Would appreciate any guidance.</p>
