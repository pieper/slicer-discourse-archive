<p>Hi, everyone—</p>
<p>I recently installed the Auto3dgm extension and have been encountering this error upon importing my data:</p>
<p>ImportError: cannot import name ‘square’ from ‘scipy’ (C:\Users\hijam\AppData\Local\slicer.org\Slicer 5.7.0-2024-04-11\lib\Python\Lib\site-packages\scipy_<em>init</em>_.py)</p>
<p>I am unsure how to resolve this issue and would appreciate any insight/advice. I am using the most recent preview release of 3D Slicer (3.7.0), as Auto3dgm is not supported on the stable release. I have confirmed that my Mosek license is also placed in the proper library.</p>
<p>Best,<br>
Jamie</p>

<p>I don’t think developers of auto3Dgm is tracking this forum. You will probably have better luck contacting them through their repo <a href="https://github.com/ToothAndClaw/SlicerAuto3dgm" class="inline-onebox">GitHub - ToothAndClaw/SlicerAuto3dgm: Repo for auto3dgm slicer extension</a></p>
<p>by opening an issue.</p>
