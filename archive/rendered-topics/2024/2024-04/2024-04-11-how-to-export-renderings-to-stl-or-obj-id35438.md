<p>You cannot export renderings (3D visualizations) as OBJ or STL, but only as jpg or png. For that you can use the ScreenCapture module. If you want to save the model you created (eg. from segmentation) as OBJ or STL, all you have to do is to right-click on the object, choose “Export As” and then choose the format as OBJ or STL.</p>
