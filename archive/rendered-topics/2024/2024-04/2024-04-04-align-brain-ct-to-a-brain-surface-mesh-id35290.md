<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>We are trying to align a Brain CT to a Brain Surface Mesh (vtkPolyData). My first thought was to apply a rigid transform to the CT manually using 3D Slicer and align the 2. But I am unable to do so. I’d appreciate it if you could please provide some pointers to try to solve this problem. Or if someone has success using other tools to perform such a task.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time!</p>
<p>Best regards,<br>
Keyur</p>
