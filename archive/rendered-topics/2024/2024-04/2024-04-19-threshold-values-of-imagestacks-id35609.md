<p>Hello, seniors</p>
<p>I reconstructed the 2D image in three dimensions using the imagestacks of the SlicerMorph module.<br>
I like how the Imageacks generates features.<br>
I want to create the same in the segmentation editor, but I wonder what parameters the imagestacks show the data with.</p>
<p>thanks a lot</p>

<p>I am not sure I understood your question. What do you mean by:</p>

</aside>
<p>ImageStacks is a utility to import sequence of 2D images into slicer. It doesn’t have any “feature” generation functionality. Any volume you imported through ImageStacks, you can use it with Segment Editor.</p>
<p>Can you explain what you are trying to do?</p>

<p>I wanted to reconstruct the 2d image using imagestacks (SlicerMorph).<br>
After importing photo data using imagestacks, I was able to check the 3D shape in the data tab.<br>
And i like the 3D shape in the data tab.</p>
<p>I’d like to export this feature to a stl file.<br>
So I thought I should make a feature on the segmentation tab (I followed the tutorial)<br>
When I adjust threshold in segmentation, I found it is different from the 3D image I saw in the data(just after the imagestacks).</p>

<p>There is still something missing here.</p>
<p>Can you please provide screenshots of what you mean by “check the 3D shape in the data tab”.</p>
<p>Or the what is different “3D image I saw in the data”</p>
