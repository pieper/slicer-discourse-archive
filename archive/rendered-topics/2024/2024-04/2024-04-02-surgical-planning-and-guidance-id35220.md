<p>Hello everyone!</p>
<p>Do you know if there is a software or 3D Slicer extension that allow doing some preoperative surgical planning over a 3D model? The idea is to simulate something like a tumor extirpation to plan which is the safest route with the least arterial compromise. I know there are already developed medical softwares that do that, but we would like something integrated within 3D slicer, or an open source one where we can export our 3D model.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance!</p>
<p>Best wishes.</p>

<p>Currently, there are related modules for cerebral hematoma puncture and mandibular bone reconstruction, which might be helpful to you.</p>
