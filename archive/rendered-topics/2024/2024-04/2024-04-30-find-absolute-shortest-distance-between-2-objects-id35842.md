<p>I am trying to take measurements, finding the absolute shortest distance between two objects on a CT scan. I have been scrolling to find what appears to be the closest point, but is there a way to use segmentation to find the absolute closest point (out of all the slices). In other words, perhaps the object 1 is at point (0,0,0) and on the same slice object 2 is an arc from (0,2,0) to (1,1,0). How can we automate finding the distance between object 1 and 2. Are there any available tools?</p>
