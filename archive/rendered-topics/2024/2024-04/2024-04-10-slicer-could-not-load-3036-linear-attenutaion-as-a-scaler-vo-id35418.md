<p>Hi,<br>
I am trying to create a 3D segmentation from DICOM CT data and am getting the error above. I think it may be due to the exceptionally large amount if data i am trying to load (~50GB). When i load smaller segments of the same data, it seems to work without issue. Is there a solution to load the entire data set?</p>
