<p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>I am looking to have a 3d reconstruction of the colon for simulation.<br>
Sorry if my question may be stupid, I am interested in colon with diverticulitis.</p>
<p>I would also like to know if there are any resources where I can get data for the reconstruction.</p>
<p>As I am new to 3D Slicer, I would like to know if there is a method or extension that allows me to do a quick 3D reconstruction.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>
