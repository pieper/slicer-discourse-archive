<p>Hi there!</p>
<p>Can anyone help me with the SegmentRegistration Module?<br>
I have reviewed the instructions in <a href="https://github.com/SlicerRt/SegmentRegistration" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">this link</a>, but the intructions seem to refer to the Prostate MRI-US Contour Propagation, with MRI and US images. (I work with several segmentations from TC images with different series).</p>
<p>I have tried several combinations in the left panel of the module, but none of them register the segmentation above the anatomical area in the CT image.<br>
