<p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>I’m currently working on a project with vessels segmentation. So I already manage to get my vessels and from that I put it in 3D Slicer and used the VMTK modules “Extract Centerline” to get the Centerline.</p>
<p>What I want, is to get the bifurcations points (coordonate) and be able to calculate the tortuosity between each points.</p>
<p>Can someone help me. Should I consider coding in Python with the whole VMTK library instead of just using 3D slicer ?</p>
