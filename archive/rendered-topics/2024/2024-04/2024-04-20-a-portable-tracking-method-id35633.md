<p>Hello everyone,<br>
I am currently using an OptiTrack system for freehand ultrasound. Could you recommend a much more portable motion-tracking system to replace OptiTrack? Can IMU sensors be used as the sole tracking method? If not, are there any other more affordable and more portable options you could suggest? I really like to have the freehand option that I can use on the go.<br>
Thanks for any help</p>
