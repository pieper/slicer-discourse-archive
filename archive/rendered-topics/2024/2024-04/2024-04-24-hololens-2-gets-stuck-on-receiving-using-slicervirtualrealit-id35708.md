<p>Hi I’m new to 3D slicer and VR. I was trying to show a 3d segmented brain model using the SlicerVirtualReality extension with openXR backend on my HoloLens2 using holographic remoting player. it says “receiving…” for an undefined amount of time. Am I doing something wrong or this takes a long time? Would appreciate any guidance <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>

<p>It should connect within a few seconds. Please use the very latest Slicer Preview Release and follow <a href="https://github.com/KitwareMedical/SlicerVirtualReality?tab=readme-ov-file#setup">these setup instructions</a>. If you still experience issues then provide detailed information about your hardware and software configuration and how you have set up your system.</p>

<p>I tried the latest Slicer Preview Release and it worked there but I tried to segment brain using Slicer Parcellation on Preview Release it made the 3Dslicer unresponsive and crashes. Can i now show volume rendered brain on the hololens2 ?</p>
