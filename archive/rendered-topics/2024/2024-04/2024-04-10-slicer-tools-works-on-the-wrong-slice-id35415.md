<p>When I use the Paint or Erase tools, the action takes place on the adjacent slide, not the one I want. And this does not happen with all slices, but only with individual ones, and I cannot find any regularity in this. Sometimes the slide above is edited, and sometimes the slide below. But it always accurately repeats the outline of the editing area that I need.<br>
What could be the problem and how to solve it?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>This shouldn’t happen, so if you have a way to reproduce it on data you can share then probably someone can look into it.</p>

I’m experiencing the same issue. Here’s a clip of it happening on one of my slices.<p></p>

<p>Is it reproducible and is that data you can share for debugging?</p>
