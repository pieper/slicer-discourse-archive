<p>Hello, I am fairly new to 3D slicer and wanted to know if I could use different colors to highlight the nerves in my project:<br>

<p>I made the whole brain as one segment, so I am unable to just change the color of the specific lobes/nerves I want to change different colors. Is it possible to use, for example, the paint brush tool (or something similar) to manually highlight the sections I want in a different color than the green that the entire brain is in?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>
