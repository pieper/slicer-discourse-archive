<p>Hello,<br>
recently, I try to find out the way slicer 3D can create connected multiple cutting-planes for surgical planning purpose. (for example: planning 3D bilateral sagittal split osteotomy, which requires standardly 3 multiple cutting planes. Could anyone tell me any extension to perform that.<br>
Thank you</p>
