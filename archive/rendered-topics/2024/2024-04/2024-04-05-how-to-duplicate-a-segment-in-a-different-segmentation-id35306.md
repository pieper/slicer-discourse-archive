<p>In the Segmentations module you should find a panel called “Copy/move segments” for doing this.</p>
<p>Have a look at the <a href="https://slicer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/modules/segmentations.html#panels-and-their-use" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">documentation</a> of the module if you need more details.</p>
