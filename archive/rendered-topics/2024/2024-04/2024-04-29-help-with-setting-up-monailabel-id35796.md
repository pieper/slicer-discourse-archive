<p>I have a problem with Monai label. With great difficulty I installed succesfully the Monai Label, so everything is ok, I able to connect to the server in the Slicer extension. My big problem is, that I want to use the Task_04 hippocampus segmentation model, or the wholeBrainSeg large model, but the hippocampus model can’t do the automatic segmentation,I am can’t able to click the button.  And the wholebrainseg is like Atlantis, I can’t find any relevant information how to setup this modell.<br>
I hope You can provides me some relevant information.<br>
Best regard,<br>
Bence</p>

<p>Hi <a class="mention" href="/u/bnc0720">@bnc0720</a>,</p>
<p>Thanks for your comment.<br>
I’d suggest we comment more about MONAI Label here: <a href="https://github.com/Project-MONAI/MONAILabel" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">GitHub - Project-MONAI/MONAILabel: MONAI Label is an intelligent open source image labeling and learning tool.</a><br>
If you don’t mind, please open a discussion with more details about the logs you’re getting when using Task_04 hippocampus and wholeBrainSeg models.</p>
<p>I’ll be happy to help,</p>
