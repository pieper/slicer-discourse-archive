<p>Hello there.</p>
<p>I’m studying about Perfusion Map in a  Segmented Lung case. The definition of this operation that I got is:<br>
"Perfusion mapping is a technique used in medical imaging to visualize and assess the distribution of blood flow in tissues or organs. It provides a detailed map showing areas of high perfusion (adequate blood supply) and areas of low perfusion (reduced blood flow). "</p>
<p>So, I would like to know if there’s any way to create a Perfusion Map, like the one below, in the 3D Slicer.</p>
