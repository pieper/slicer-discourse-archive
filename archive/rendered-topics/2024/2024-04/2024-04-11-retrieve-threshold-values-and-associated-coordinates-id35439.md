<p>I’d like to be able to retrieve the threshold values for the part I’ve segmented with the associated coordinates. The aim is to be able to use it to define mechanical values in finite element software. Do you have any idea of the procedure to follow if this is possible?</p>

<p>Apart from noting it down what you specified, I don’t think there is a way to record the threshold values. If you used automated method (e.g., OTSU) rerunning them on the same data will give you the exactly same values.</p>
