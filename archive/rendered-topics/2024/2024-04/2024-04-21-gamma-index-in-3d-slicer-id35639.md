<p>3D slicer version: 5.2.2<br>
Hi every one<br>
I  have 2 RT Dose. In the 3D Slicer software, using the gamma comparison module, these dose distributions obtained from the TPS have been compared. In this process, the CT images imported into the TPS have a slice thickness of 5 mm , and the analysis indices were 3%-3mm.<br>
considering that in these conditions, the 3mm index is less than the spatial resolution of the CT (which is 5mm), how does the 3D Slicer software perform this task?</p>
<p>Thanks a lot</p>
