<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I’m working with the AnglePlanes extension in 3D Slicer and encountering an issue where clicking to place a single landmark results in multiple landmarks being created along the path of my cursor movement. This makes precise landmark placement difficult.</p>
<p>Things I’ve tried:</p>
<p>Using a different mouse/trackpad.<br>
Adjusting mouse sensitivity and double-click speed.<br>
Restarting 3D Slicer.<br>
Using an older version of 3D Slicer<br>
Reinstalling the AnglePlanes extension.<br>
My setup:</p>
<p>3D Slicer version: 5.6.1/ 5.4<br>
AnglePlanes extension version: Revision: 702ca19<br>
Operating System: Windows 11<br>
Has anyone else encountered this behavior? Any suggestions or troubleshooting tips would be greatly appreciated. Attached a video showing the bug for reference.</p>
<p>Thank you!<br>
