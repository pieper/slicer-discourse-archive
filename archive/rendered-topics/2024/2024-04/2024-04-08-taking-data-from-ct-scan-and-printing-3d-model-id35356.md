<p>Operating system: windows<br>
Slicer version: 5.6.1<br>
Expected behavior: setting a ROI and creating a 3d printable model<br>
Actual behavior: images are shown in 3 of the 4 windows, but have not been able to create a ROI image in the 3D window.</p>
<p>I am a newbie to 3D Slicer and DICOM files.  I have scan files of my chest and want to print the ROI of my heart.  I know how to 3D print once I have a STL.  I am not able to create the model from my data.<br>
Thank you for your support.</p>

<p>Have you been though the training material?  Get things working with the sample data and then try the same on your data.<br>
