<p><a class="mention" href="/u/diego_fabian">@Diego_fabian</a> if you are new to 3D Slicer I would recommend you to first become familiar with the application and the possibilities it offers; you can also explore the wide repertoire of extensions in the extension manager. With this you can already do quite interesting things. If you want to go further, you can think of creating your own 3D Slicer extension, which would require some knowledge in Python (C++ is also an option) and how 3D Slicer extensions work (a good entry point is the <a href="https://slicer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer_guide/index.html" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Developer Guide</a>.</p>
