<p>I extracted the centerline of a vessel by the VMTK module. I want to import the centerline to Paraview. The RAS coordinates seem not aligned with the geometry (STL) in ParaView.<br>
My question is how to transform the coordinates to let the centerline appear in the right place in Paravew.<br>
Also is it possible to export the centerline as a STL file? Currently, I export the centerline as csv file and import it into Paraview. If it can be exported to STL, the coordinate system of the centerline.STL should be consistent with the vessel.stl.</p>
