<p>I uploaded my .obj into slicer and the pink/purple box that surrounds it is is way off. The model appears at the top right corner of the box and the box is super big. Is there a way to resize the box so that it fits closer to the model?</p>

<p>The box fits to the data in the scene, so probably there’s something invisible affecting it.  Try deleting some things from your data tree.  Or maybe there are points in your obj file that you don’t see.  Try the Surface Toolbox to clean it up.</p>

<p>Sorry, if it is obvious, but have you clicked the “Center view” button after loading the .obj?</p>
