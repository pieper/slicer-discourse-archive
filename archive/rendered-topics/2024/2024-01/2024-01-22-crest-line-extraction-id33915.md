<p>Hi, I am working in 3D Slicer with surface models of human skeletal bones (mainly humeri at the moment). My goal is to crop these models based on anatomical landmarks and other features, so that they can be used for further analysis. I am working on automating the workflow, so that I am able to process the models more efficiently and in a standardized way. Up until now, this workflow included the tracing of an existing crest with a curve node (through several control points) and then remove it with the “Select by points” function in the dynamic modeler module. In terms of automatisation, I thought it may be more effective (and objective) to extract the crest line from the model directly, but I haven’t found any feature that may do this. Does 3D Slicer have a function for this? Many thanks in advance!</p>
