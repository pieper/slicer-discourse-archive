<p>I know this is a very specific topic, but I have 3 different models (or segments) and I want to create a point in a surface (or mesh) that is X% distant from model A, Y% distant from model B and Z% distant from model C, given X, Y and Z. In practice, it will be useful to create a “plot graph” on a skull.</p>
