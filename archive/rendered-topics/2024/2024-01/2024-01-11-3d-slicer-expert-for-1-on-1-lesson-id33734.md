<p>I’m hoping to find someone to assist me with a new project that our company is working on.<br>
The specific requirement is to demonstrate to someone the CT scan procedure we must follow and comprehend the most effective procedure and tools to use in order to do the task. Do you know of any recommended specialist?</p>
<p>Many thanks</p>
