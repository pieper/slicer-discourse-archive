<p>Good day.<br>
I tried to use tomoSAM extension on a DICOM CT scan which had dtype of int32, and was unable to create embeddings because int32 is not supported. I used cast scalar module to convert that series into float, double, short and none of them worked. Could you tell me how to change data into other types like int?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance<br>
