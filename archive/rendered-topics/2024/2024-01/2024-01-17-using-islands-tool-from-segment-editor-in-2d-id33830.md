<p>Islands tool is currently available for 3D. I mean, “islands” are computed as connected components in 3D.</p>
<p>Is it possible to set “islands” as connected components in 2D?</p>

<p>You mean you would like to restrict the connected components to a slice by slice segmentation (i.e connected only in 2D not in 3D). if so, no I don’t think that’s possible nor wanted in 3D Slicer.</p>
