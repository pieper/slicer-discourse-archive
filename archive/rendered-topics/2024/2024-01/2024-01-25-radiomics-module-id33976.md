<p>Good Morning,</p>
<p>can someone please help me find a working version of radiomics module for 3D Slicer 5.4.0? I cannot find it anymore in the available modules to be downloaded.</p>

<p>Sorry for the trouble. I am not sure. This has been a long standing issue, see <a href="https://github.com/AIM-Harvard/SlicerRadiomics/issues/78" class="inline-onebox">SlicerRadiomics extension cannot be found on mac · Issue #78 · AIM-Harvard/SlicerRadiomics · GitHub</a> for related discussion. I personally have not been able to allocate time to look into this, even thought it might be very easy to fix.</p>
