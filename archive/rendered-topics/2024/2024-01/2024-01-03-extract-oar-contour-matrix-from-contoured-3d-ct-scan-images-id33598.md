<p>Dear community,</p>
<p>I am new to 3D Slicer, and I have a complete RT plan (CT (a set of image slices), RTPLAN, RTDOSE, RTSTRUCT) and I wanted to extract OAR contour matrix from the contoured 3D CT-scan images. Can I extract it using 3D Slicer, and if so, what steps I need to follow to extract that matrix for each OAR?</p>
<p>Thank you so much!!</p>
<p>Best regards,<br>
Sanchita</p>
