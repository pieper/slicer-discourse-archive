<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I’ve created a QMenu with three actions and set icons to the actions using the setIcon method. The problem is that I am not able to adjust the size of the icons in the QMenu. Is there a way to change it?</p>

<p>This is a pure Qt question (not related to Slicer) and the answer may not be trivial, so it would be better if you could search for answer on Qt forum or StackOverflow, or ask Copilot or ChatGPT.</p>
