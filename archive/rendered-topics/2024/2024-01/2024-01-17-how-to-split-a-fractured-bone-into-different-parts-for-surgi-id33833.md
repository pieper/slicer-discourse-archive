<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have a database of bone fracture DICOM images that I am using to create a surgical simulation for bone reduction surgery. As part of this, I want to create a 3D model of the bone, and have the bone in two parts, split along the fracture. This will enable the model to be used in surgical simulation.</p>
<p>Is it possible to do this in 3D Slicer?</p>
<p>Thank you in advance.</p>

<p>This is doable by using the Segment Editor module of the Slicer.</p>
