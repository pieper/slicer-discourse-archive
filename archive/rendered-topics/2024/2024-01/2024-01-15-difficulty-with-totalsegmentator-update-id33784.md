<p>Dear 3D slicer community,</p>
<p>I would like to perform automatic segmentation of long bones (ulna, radius, humerus, femur, tibia and fibula) with the TotalSegmentator update. However, despite having installed slicer 5.6.1 and the TotalSegmentator extension with the updates, the segmentation does not work with the new features and only segments bones from the old version (only humerus and femur).</p>
<p>Have you encountered this problem? Can you help me?</p>
