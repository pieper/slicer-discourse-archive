<p>Hello, I am new to this tool and slicer in general but have been running 3d print everything a printing service for years now.<br>
This tool you have is amazing and very useful!<br>
I do have some questions! I am working with UTSW in Dallas on some research projects to export bones and 3d print them for several different research projects.<br>
One would be exporting bones with fractures, would it be possible to train a set so that bones could have a separated crack/fracture segment?<br>
If I could get a quick/easy way to 3d model fractures on bones segmented from totalsegmentator it would make our workflow fast enough to make this useful for future research/patient explanation of surgeries ect<br>
If possible to what would that entail as far as cost and time goes?</p>

<p>I would recommend the <a href="https://github.com/sebastianandress/Slicer-SurfaceWrapSolidify?tab=readme-ov-file#surface-wrap-solidify">SurfaceWrapSolidify extension</a> for this, which was specifically developed for creating 3D-printable models of fractured bones in a way that the fracture is accurately preserved.</p>
