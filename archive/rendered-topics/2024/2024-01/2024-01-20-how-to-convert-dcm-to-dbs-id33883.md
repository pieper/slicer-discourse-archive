<p>Hello, I have several ultrasound images in dicom format (.dcm) that were exported from a GE Vivid i (in dicom format) but were not analyzed in the GE and then deleted from the system. In order for me to analyze the images, my understanding is that it needs to be converted to the raw format but I am not sure if there is another way.</p>
<p>Thank you so much in advance for your help!!</p>
<p>Original format (that can be imported and reanalyzed):<br>
