<p>Hello SlicerSALT developers, community,</p>
<p>Quick question regarding how the Covariate Significance Testing (MFSDA) module treats variables/covariates as they are listed on the input CSV:</p>
<p>Does MFSDA distinguish between variables that are categorical (nominal, ordinal, etc.) vs. continuous data? I have covariates describing cognitive status (1/2/3 - normal, mild cognitive impairment, dementia) that are obviously ordinal due to increasing severity, as well as binary covariates for sex and continuous variables for a certain performance metric. Will MFSDA understand that some variables are nominal or ordinal, rather than continuous? Just asking since I’m aware that treating variables as nominal/ordinal vs. continuous does have an impact on the statistics.</p>
<p>Thanks!<br>
KVM</p>
