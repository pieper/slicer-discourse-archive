<p>Hi all, I´m new in the forum. Did every one used/has a MacStudio M2 MAX…? I´m not sure to buy one of them (but I want to…), but I can not found personal experiences with using this Mac and Slicer. I´m interested mainly to work with MicroCT, rendering and segmentation.<br>
Sorry by my spanglish, but any help would be appreciated.  Thanks in advance,<br>

<p>I haven’t tried a MacStudio, but the macbook air m2 works fine for me and I would expect performance to scale well with memory and cores for any of the apple silicon.</p>

<p>Ok, many thanks Steve. So…  I´ll try to buy the MacStudio (in the hope there will be no problems). Saludos, fredy</p>
