<p>Hi<br>
I just need to extract some 3D data, hopefully and Preferably something in .SAT format. but as 3d slicer just exports .stl files, I just have a shell from my segmentation, does anybody have an idea about what should I do? is there any way I could be able to export domains and 3d objects from 3d slicer?</p>
