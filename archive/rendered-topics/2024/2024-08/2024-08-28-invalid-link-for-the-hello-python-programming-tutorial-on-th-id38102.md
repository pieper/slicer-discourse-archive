<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>I noticed that the link to the “Hello Python Programming” tutorial PDF on the official SlicerIGT website (<a href="https://www.slicer.org/w/img_auth.php/c/c0/Slicer4_ProgrammingTutorial_Slicer4.5.pdf" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://www.slicer.org/w/img_auth.php/c/c0/Slicer4_ProgrammingTutorial_Slicer4.5.pdf</a>) is not valid. When clicking on the link, it leads to a error page.</p>
<p>I have tried accessing the link using different WiFi networks and browsers, but it still doesn’t work.</p>
<p>This tutorial is very helpful for new developers who want to learn Python programming with 3D Slicer, so it would be great if the link could be fixed.</p>
<p>Thank you very much for your attention!</p>

<p>Thanks for reporting. Where exactly did you find this link?</p>
<p>You can find up-to-date links to tutorials in the <a href="https://slicer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer_guide/api.html#tutorials">Slicer documentation</a>. Currently, the Slicer Programming Tutorial is available <a href="https://github.com/PerkLab/PerkLabBootcamp/raw/master/Doc/day3_2_SlicerProgramming.pptx">here</a>.</p>

<p>Thank you for your reply. I found the incorrect link on the page <a href="https://www.slicerigt.org/wp/developer-tutorial/" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Developer tutorial | SlicerIGT</a>, by clicking on “Hello Python Tutorial on the Slicer website.”</p>
<p>Thank you again for your attention!</p>
