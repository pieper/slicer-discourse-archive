<p>Hi<br>
I want to load a dataset that has segments and then i have an xlm file with the name for each segment. Is there any easy way of making the names link to the segments?</p>

<p>You can load the label file into Slicer as a color table. After that when you load the volume file in Add data module you can select that color table in the additional options on the right side.</p>
