<p>Hi Team,<br>
We would like to notify the community that are building an extension module that interfaces with a SPECT reconstruction library, Pytomography (<a href="https://pypi.org/project/pytomography/" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">pytomography · PyPI</a>). This is to provide a graphic user interface for the library and also make it easier for users to leverage the other available modules in 3d slicer to use on their reconstructed volumes. The proposed name of the module is SlicerSPECTRecon and we hope to make a submission soon.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>
