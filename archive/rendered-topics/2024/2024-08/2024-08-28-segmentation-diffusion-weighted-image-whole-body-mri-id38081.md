<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am trying to find a better way to perform a manual segmentation of numerous lesions on Whole Body DWI of multiple patient. These lesions exhibit high signal intensity on high b-values. I tried a few tools to improve my speed and accuracy (Level Tracing, Thresholding, Fill between Slices) but it requires a lot of manual correction. I also tried to use the Segmentation Tools (MONAI, SAM) but it seems that they are less performant on body DWI. Do you have any input or advices?</p>
<p>Thanks a lot for your help!</p>
