<p>Operating system: Windows<br>
Slicer version: 5.2.2<br>
Expected behavior: To see 3D images<br>
Actual behavior: Can not see 3D images</p>
<p>Hello,<br>
I have CT Scans images taken at the hospital in DICOM format. When I load those images. I get the following message: Reference image in series does not contain geometry information.</p>
<p>How can I solve this problem?</p>

<p>Those are screenshots (secondary capture images). They are not suitable for 3D reconstruction, processing, or analysis.</p>
