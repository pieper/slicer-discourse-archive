<p>Hello.</p>
<p>I am doing a study comparing the changes in the two time points of 2 dcm files.</p>
<ol>
<li>A specific bone (from dcm file) was segmented  and saved as a ‘stl’ file.<br>
After that, in order to compare the changes in the two structures, we want to <strong>use a specific segmented part of the structure as mask</strong> in model registration.<br>
we already made a partial segmentation in this structure.</li>
</ol>
<p>I would like to know the process required for this process.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>I’m trying to use color map to visualize changes in skeleton, and I’ve seen the process of comparing using vtk files on YouTube.</li>
</ol>
<p>However, we do not know how to store the segmented results in vtk type.</p>
<p>Your writings are very helpful in our research.</p>
<p>I’d like to hear your opinions on the two questions above.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
