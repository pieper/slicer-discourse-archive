<p>Hi all!<br>
New here.<br>
I’m a student working on project whereby a needle must be tracked with a 3D model (of the needle) across different scan views in 3D slicer. I was wondering what modules/add-ons would be needed as well as what kind of accuracy can be expected? I do have access to a realsense camera.<br>
I am also looking for tutoring/developers who a familiar with python to help make some automations.<br>
Thanks</p>
