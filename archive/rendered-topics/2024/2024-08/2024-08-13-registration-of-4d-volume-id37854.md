<p>How can I register for the 4D volume that I have<br>
it is time-consuming to do for each and then recombine the volume again<br>
Are there any other possible ways (My volume is T2* MGE)</p>

<p>Hi Aylin,<br>
If you are using Elastix for the registration, you can use the extension <a href="https://github.com/moselhy/SlicerSequenceRegistration" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Sequence Registration</a>. I’ve used that to register breast DCEMRI datasets and works pretty well.<br>
Regards<br>
