<p>Hello,</p>
<p>For this project I am working on, I am trying to use Python to draw a circle where the circle’s edge sits on an outline of a specific feature in a 2D image. I would like the program to be able to automatically identify the structure in the image and draw the circle.</p>
<p>Here is a manually drawn circle as an example of what I am trying to do:</p>
<p><img src="https://us1.discourse-cdn.com/flex002/uploads/slicer/original/3X/c/3/c36902255a732f3ef9e92a601a5c69fdb4b4d75e.png" alt="image" data-base62-sha1="rSG5lcckkny7G9dQ6pZoncLpDT8" width="183" height="172"></p>
<p>The reference image has been rescaled so the pixels are anisotropic.</p>
<p>I don’t really have experience with 3D Slicer and its libraries though I am experienced with Python so I would like some guidance on where to start.</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
