<p>The Play button appears to only allow cine-display of three orthogonal 2D views but not of the 4D volume. Using Segmentation Editor, seeds only grow within the volume at one time point of a 4D dataset.</p>
<p>How to make seeds grow in the volume throughout the cardiac cycle?</p>
<p>How to cine-display the 3D object?</p>
<p>Many thanks in advance. Jing</p>

    Thanks for your reply. I’ve tried these steps but how to extend the segmentation to other frames? Do you have any video or tutorial on how to do this?
