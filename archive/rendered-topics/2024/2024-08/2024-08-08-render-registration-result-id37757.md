<p>Hi, all.</p>
<p>This question is related to</p>
<p><a href="https://discourse.slicer.org/t/rendering-for-ct-and-dsa-registration/37662">Rendering for CT and dsa registration - Development - 3D Slicer Community</a></p>
<p>My partner want to display projected plane . and take 3d view as renderwindow</p>
<pre><code>the reques is as below:
</code></pre>
<p>1- mouse event , such as scale is invalid.</p>
<p>The projected contour only changed if moved or rotate.</p>
<p>2 - the contour or renderwindow should be transparent, so DSA image in background can be displayed</p>
<p>Is it possible to do this?</p>
<p>Or is it easier to render image in slice/2d window, Then I think should add custom mouse event in 2d window</p>
<p>Any suggestion will be very appreciated!</p>
