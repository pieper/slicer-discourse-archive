<p>Hello,<br>
I’m currently working on preparing a 3D mask from a volumetric dataset to train a Stardist 3D model. As part of this process, I need to annotate different cells within the volume, each with a unique color.</p>
<p>Could you please advise if there’s a way to accomplish this directly within 3D Slicer? Are there any plugins or tools available that support this kind of annotation?</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for your help!</p>
