<p>Hello.</p>
<p>I studied compare 2 time volumes (with surface)</p>
<p>I have dicom CBCT files. and I segmented mandible and export as STL format.</p>
<p>I want to use color map on comparing 2 time point change.</p>
<p>May be it’s too basic to ask to specialists.</p>
<ul>
<li>Is there any way to compare 2 STL file change using color map?</li>
</ul>
<p>I think population viewer need onlt VTK files.</p>
<p>But converting .stl to .vtk is also struggle to me.</p>
<p>Please guide me how to compare stl files with color map in Slicer.</p>
<p>Way to converting stl to vtl / dcm to vtk would be big help to me.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
