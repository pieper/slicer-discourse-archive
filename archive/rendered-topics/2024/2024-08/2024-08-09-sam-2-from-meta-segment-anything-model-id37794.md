<p>Hello everyone,<br>
I just wanted to check if anyone has seen this and thought about implementing into the Total Segmentator. I feel like the Total Segmentator is really good already but when it comes to segmenting vertebrae with instrumentation it can get quite tricky.<br>
I was wondering if this new model from META  (since it is open source) could be used to improve on what Slicer has already?</p>
