<p>Method 1: Can I directly use the SlicerOpenIGTLink plug-in to establish a connection with NDI? Only use this plug-in without using any other software<br>
Method 2: Use Plus Server to establish a connection with NDP, and then connect with the slicer plug-in? However, I keep failing to establish a connection with NDP using Plus Server. I don’t know what’s going on.<br>
Help!!!</p>
