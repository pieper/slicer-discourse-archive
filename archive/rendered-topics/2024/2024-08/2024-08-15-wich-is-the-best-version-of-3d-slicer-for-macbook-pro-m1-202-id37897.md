<p>I have the Macbook Pro M1 and when I install 3D Slicer doesn’t open! What can I do? What’s the best version for my computer?</p>

<p>I have macbook pro M3 and Slicer works fine. I believe there are number of people who are using it on M1 fine as well.</p>
<p>Remember by default MacOS does not allow you to run software you downloaded right away (at least not easily). After you install slicer, instead of double clicking the Slicer icon, do CMD+click and choose open.</p>
