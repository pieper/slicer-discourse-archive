<p>I use the “fill between slices” to interpolate masks on different slices. My mask can be a thin line (1-2 pixel wide). In that case, the tool doesn’t generate any mask in the intermediate slices. Making the lines thicker works. I’m wondering if there is any threshold that can be changed to work for a thin line.<br>
Thanks!<br>
