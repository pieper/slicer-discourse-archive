<p>Hello. I am running 3D Slicer 5.2.2 on a Windows machine. Want to install the TotalSegmentator extension but receive attached error messages each time. Would appreciate any help on how to accomplish this.</p>

<p>Update: I was able to resolve the issue by downloading the extension file from <a href="https://extensions.slicer.org/catalog/All/31317/win" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">@KitwareMedical/slicer-extensions-webapp</a>.</p>

<p>Please use the latest stable, 5.6.2. Older releases are not maintained.</p>
