<p>Hello,<br>
I would like some advice on the best methods for automated or manual segmentation of the sphenoid bone, including it’s Pterygoid process, for an analysis of craniofacial sexual dimorphism in two populations (European-American and Hispanic-American).</p>
<p>I am relatively new to segmentation editing, and I would like to know a method that captures subtle size/ shape variation. Thresholding itself may not be sufficient, and manual drawing for each CT slice is slow. Thank you for the help.</p>
