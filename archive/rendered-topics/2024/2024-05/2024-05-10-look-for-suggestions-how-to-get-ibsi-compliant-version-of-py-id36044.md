<p>Dear All,</p>
<p>One comment from reviewer for my radiomic paper is: “According to their documentation, the fixed bin width method implemented in pyradiomics is not compliant with the IBSI reference standard. This has been found to lead to issues regarding robustness [2] (2. Wright DE, Cook C, Klug J, Korfiatis P, Kline TL. Reproducibility in medical image radiomic studies: contribution of dynamic histogram binning. arXiv [eess.IV]. 2022. doi:10.48550/arXiv.2211.05241 - attached in email). Please use an IBSI-compliant version of pyradiomics or a different software.”</p>
<p>The document in Pyradiomics is: <a href="https://pyradiomics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Frequently Asked Questions — pyradiomics v3.1.0rc2.post5+g6a761c4 documentation</a></p>
<p>So how could I look for IBSI-compliant version of pyradiomics?</p>

<p>I don’t think there is one, but you could ask here: <a href="https://github.com/AIM-Harvard/pyradiomics" class="inline-onebox">GitHub - AIM-Harvard/pyradiomics: Open-source python package for the extraction of Radiomics features from 2D and 3D images and binary masks.
