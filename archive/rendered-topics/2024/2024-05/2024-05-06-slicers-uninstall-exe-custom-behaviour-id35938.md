<p>Hello again,</p>
<p>I’ve installed Slicer in the <code>C:\Program Files\Slicer 5.7.0-2024-04-29</code> directory on Windows. During the uninstallation process, Slicer does not seem to remove the entire <code>Slicer 5.7.0-2024-04-29</code> directory, but only some inner directories.</p>
<p>I would like to modify this behavior to ensure that the entire directory is removed from <code>Program Files</code>, and also to remove a few other files from another location. How can I achieve this?</p>
