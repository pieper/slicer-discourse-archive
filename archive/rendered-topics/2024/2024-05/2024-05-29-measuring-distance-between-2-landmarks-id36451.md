<p>Hi all, Im working on a project where I need to measure the distance on between 2 anatomical landmarks without having to slice my microCT 3D samples. I would like to avoid slicing because my landmarks are not all in the same plane. I was wondering of 3D slicer offers a feature that could help me do that.</p>

<p>Yes, you can easily measure the 3D distance between two landmarks using 3D Slicer.  The easiest way to do this is with a MarkupsLine <a href="https://slicer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/modules/markups.html#overview" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Markups — 3D Slicer documentation</a></p>
