<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>I want to download the sample data from Registration Library (<a href="https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/Nightly/Registration/RegistrationLibrary" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Registration Library</a>). But when I clicked on download link, every link went to Not found Page indicating “The requested URL was not found on the server. If you entered the URL manually please check your spelling and try again.”.</p>
<p>I don’t know the reason. Hope for some advice. Thank you very much.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Crayon</p>

<p>Thanks for the report - I believe these links should be updated but I’m not sure where they should point now.  <a class="mention" href="/u/jcfr">@jcfr</a> or <a class="mention" href="/u/sam_horvath">@Sam_Horvath</a> do you know?</p>
