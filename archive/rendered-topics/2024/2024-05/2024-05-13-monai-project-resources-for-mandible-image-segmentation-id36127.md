<p>Hello, we are a medical research team from Duke &amp; JHU, currently working on image segmentation tasks for damaged mandibles. I have reviewed your MONAI project, and I am impressed by the results. I would like to inquire if your team could provide the corresponding source code and dataset for our use. Thank you very much.</p>

<p>Thank you for your reply! I have found those data sample, but I did not find any mandible ones. In addition, do you guys have any damaged mandible dataset for training model?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>What exactly are you looking for ? are you looking for CT data files of Mandibles ? and What you mean by Damaged ? Cancer ? trauma ? Odontogenic tumors ?</p>

<p>Yes, I am looking for dataset including CT scan data together with segmentation of damaged mandible. And the damaged means mandibles with defects from cancer since our study is on head and neck cancer reconstruction. Thanks!</p>
