<p>Hello, last week I changed the background of the 3D view to be white and now I cannot see my segmentations. Is there a way to revert it back to normal?</p>
<p>Here is an image about what I mean:</p>

<p>That looks like a plot view.<br>
You can switch to a layout with a 3D view such as Four-Up or Conventional.</p>
