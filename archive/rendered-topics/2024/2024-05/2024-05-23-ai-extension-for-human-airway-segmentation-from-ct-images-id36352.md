<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>Hope you all are doing well.<br>
I am working on Human airway segmentation from CT scans. I wonder if we have any AI (fully automated) extension that can self segment the human airway? I tried “Airway segmentation”, “Lung CT segmenter”, and “Segment Editor/grow from seeds and fast marching”. But they showed very bad results and even I used scissors to cut, the 3d model still cannot use.</p>
