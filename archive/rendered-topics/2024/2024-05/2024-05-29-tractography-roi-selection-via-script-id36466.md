<p>Operating system: Ubutu 22.04<br>
Slicer version: 5.6.2<br>
I would like to automatically extract fiber bundles from a UKF tractography vtk file using the Tractography ROI selection module. I have a label map that contains FreeSurfer labels as well as some manually created labels. I want to use a script to automatically extract the fiber bundle for each pair of labels. Could anyone guide me on which Slicer function I should use? I am looking for a module similar to slicer.mrmlScene.AddNewNodeByClass(“vtkMRMLTractographyROISelection…”).</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for your help!</p>
