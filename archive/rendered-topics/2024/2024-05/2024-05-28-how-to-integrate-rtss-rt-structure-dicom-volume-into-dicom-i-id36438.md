<p>I would like to express my gratitude to the developers who made these good programs publicly available.</p>
<p>I have one more question.<br>
As far as I know, the RTSS-DICOM (RT structure) file does not include MR image or CT image, just have Volume information, such as labeled tumor volume.<br>
I want to get the Volume of Interest (VOI) from the RTSS-DICOM file, draw it on the MR DICOM image, and then get the segmented DICOM file (VOI with MR image).</p>
<p>How can I do this work?</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
