<p>Hi support team,</p>
<p>I frequently encounter an issue where the following message appears while using the (level tracing) tool repeatedly, prompting me to restart the app in order to continue. Do you have any solutions for this?<br>
I am using Slicer 5.6.2 on Windows 11.</p>

<p>Thank you in advance.</p>

<p>Based on the message that’s probably not fatal, so you may be able to ignore it.</p>
<p>But it’s should happen so if you have steps that can reproduce it with data you can share that would help.</p>
