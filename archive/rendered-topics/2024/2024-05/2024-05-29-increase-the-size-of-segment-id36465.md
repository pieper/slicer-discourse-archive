<p>You can use <a href="https://slicer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/modules/segmenteditor.html#cannot-paint-outside-some-boundaries">specify geometry button</a> in Segment Editor module to modify the extent.</p>

<p>I think the feature was already available in Slicer-5.4, but I’m not sure. Please use the latest Slicer Stable Release or latest Slicer Preview Release, as they contain lots of fixes and improvements.</p>
