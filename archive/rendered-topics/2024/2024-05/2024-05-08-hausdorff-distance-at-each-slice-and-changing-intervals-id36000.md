<p>I am trying to find the Hausdorff distances in the Segment Comparison module between two catheters but I don’t know what the interval is for the Hausdorff metric. I want to adjust the interval to be at 1mm and 5mm. How do I print out what the interval is and how would I change it?</p>
<p>Another problem I have it trying to print out the Hausdorff distance for each slice or whatever the interval might be. Is there a way to do that?</p>
<p>Any help would be great, thanks!</p>
