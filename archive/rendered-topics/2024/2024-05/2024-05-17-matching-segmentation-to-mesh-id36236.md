<p>Hi, I am new to 3D slicer. I am working with a mesh that was created from MRI data. I want to match the segmentations to the mesh. for example I have a head mesh and I want to see which part of the region corresponds to which part of the mesh. Or If I can merge the masks of the segmentation to the mesh so that I can get the regions in the mesh for that part of the segment. can I do it in 3D slicer ? or can someone suggest some ways</p>
