<p>Operating system:windows<br>
Slicer version:5.7.0<br>
Expected behavior:the images are seen normally<br>
Actual behavior: when I try to move back and forth to the next image, the LSA value bar shift automatically and the images disappear</p>

<p>I’m not sure ehat you mean by “LSA value bar” but if you mean the the slice selector slider above a slice viewer then most likely you cannot browse the image because you loaded only a single slice or the image was loaded as a time sequence (so you can browse it with the Sequence browser toolbar).</p>
