<p>Hello,<br>
I am using the Bone Angle Meter plug-in, which requires that a pop-up window be created when the measurements right/left function is called upon. Unfortunately, the pop-up window does not show up on my MacBook Pro. I am only aware of how to enable pop-ups for Safari. Can someone tell me how to correct this issue and enable pop-ups for Slicer? Thank you for the help!<br>
Rod</p>

<p>Great - if the original developers can’t replicate the issue, maybe at least they could point to the area of the code where the window is created and maybe others will have suggestions.</p>
