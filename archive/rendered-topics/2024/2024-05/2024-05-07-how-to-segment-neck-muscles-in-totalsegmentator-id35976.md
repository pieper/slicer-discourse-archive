<p>TotalSegmentator proves to be a valuable asset for segmentation tasks. While it effectively segments back muscles in CT scans, it encounters limitations in segmenting neck muscles. I am keen to understand the underlying reasons for this discrepancy. Thank you for your assistance in this matter.</p>
