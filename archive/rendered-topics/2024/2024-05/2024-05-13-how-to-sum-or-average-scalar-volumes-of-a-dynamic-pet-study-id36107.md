<p>Dear all,<br>
is there anybody who can give me a suggestion on how to sum the different time-point images of a 4-frame dynamic PET scan I loaded from DICOM importer, and result in a single “static” scan?</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>
Angelo</p>

<p>Have you tried the “Add Scalar Volumes” module? It’s in the category Filtering / Arithmetic.</p>

<p>Thanks for the clue! I separated out the four frames and then I summed them up…</p>
<p>Ciao</p>

<p>Hi, would you like to share the whole procedure? I only need to sum the 60-120 min dynamic PET imaging, can 3D slice make it? thank you so much for your support.</p>
