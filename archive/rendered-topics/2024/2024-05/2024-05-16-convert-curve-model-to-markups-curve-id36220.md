<p>I have curve that is a vtp model and would like to convert it into a markups curve that I can edit. slicer can do this conversion but it always creates a closed curve, when my curves are always open, please help. Thanks so much</p>

<p>edit, i think the error has something to do with point ordering, not closing the curve, the last and first points are a bit misordered</p>

<p>Do you still need assistance with this? Please try to fix the point order and let us know if there is still some issue present. If so, we’ll probably need a sample vtp file to try.</p>
