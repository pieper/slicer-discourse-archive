<p>Hey Slicer Crew,</p>
<p>Having a bit of a battle with Slicer’s edge attraction feature when I’m drawing segment contours.  Every time I try to use it, I get this error message that throws a wrench in the whole process.  The message itself isn’t super helpful, making it tough to figure out what’s going wrong.</p>
<p>I’ve poked around the settings in Slicer, but no luck yet.  Anyone else ever face this edge attraction error when drawing contours?  If so, any advice on how to squash this bug?<br>
I also check this : <a href="https://discourse.slicer.org/t/draw-segment-contour-with-attracted-to-edges/333">Draw segment contour with attracted to edges</a><a href="https://www.igmguru.com/data-science-bi/alteryx-training/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">alteryx</a> But I have not found any solution.</p>
<p>Also, if there are any secret handshake settings or best practices for smooth, error-free contour drawing with edge attraction, I’m all ears (and eyes!).</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for any help!</p>

<p>We only draw contours as a last resort, when everything else fails, so edge attraction is not really relevant. What are you segmenting? What error you are getting, using which module?</p>
