<p>operating system: windows<br>
slicer version: 5.6.2<br>
I can’t modify the window that is used to represent the data by clicking and dragging the left mouse button.The images I am using are CT images in DICOM format. I would appreciate your help.</p>

<p>Did you change the mouse mode to window/level?<br>
