<p>Hi All,<br>
Apologies for this basic question.<br>
I am new to 3D Slicer. I am interested to perform radiomics on RTSTRUCT file downloaded from TCIA database.</p>
<p>How can I view a RTSTRUCT DICOM file in 3D Slicer.</p>
<p>I have downloaded SlicerRT but nothing was showing when I tried to import the RTSTRUCT DICOM file.</p>
<p>Many thanks</p>
