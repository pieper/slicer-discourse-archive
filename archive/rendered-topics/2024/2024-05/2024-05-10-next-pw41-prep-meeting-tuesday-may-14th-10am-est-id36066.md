<p>Preparation: To prepare, we will be holding weekly meetings at 10am on Tuesdays, starting April 30th, 2024 and ending on June 18th. Please join at <a href="https://ntnu.zoom.us/j/94105383302?pwd=alVLSG1ITVhSUmpqVG9VMkMwOURrUT09">this link</a> if you have a project that you would like to present or work on during project week.</p>
<p>Background: The Project Week is a week-long hackathon of hands on activity in which medical image computing researchers create solutions using the open source image computing platform, 3D Slicer, and VTK, ITK, CMake, and CDash libraries as well as OHIF, Cornerstone, dcmjs, vtkjs, itkjs, DICOMweb, Girder and related web technologies. Participants work collaboratively on solutions that lie at the interfaces of the fields of computer science, mechanical engineering, biomedical engineering, and medicine. In contrast to conferences and workshops where the primary focus is to report results, the objective of the ProjectWeek is to provide a venue for creators of medical image computing open-source software creators to collaboratively work</p>
