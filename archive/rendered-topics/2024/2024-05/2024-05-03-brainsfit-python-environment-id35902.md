<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I am trying to perform registration of two MRI modalities of the same subject using BRAINSfit in a non-slicer python environment. I try to use the method described in this link <a>https://www.slicer.org/w/index.php/Documentation/4.1/Modules/BRAINSFit</a>. However, when I access the folder of ‘Slicer-5.6.2-linux-amd64/lib/Slicer-5.6/cli-modules’ and try to run ‘BRAINSFit’, it has the error of</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‘BRAINSFit: command not found’<br>
Does anyone know how to run the BRAINSFit properly in terminal?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thanks!</p>
<p>Best,<br>
Zoey</p>

<p>Update: the problem solved by adding whatever paths that are missing using ‘export’ command.</p>
