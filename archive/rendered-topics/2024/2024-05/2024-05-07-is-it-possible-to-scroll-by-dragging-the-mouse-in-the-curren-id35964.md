<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I was wondering if there is a way to use a keyboard shortcut and drag the mouse to scroll through the slices in the current selected view. I know that it is possible to use the shift key and then drag mouse to scroll through the corresponding view, but is it also possible to do it in the selected view for ease of performing annotation?</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

<p>Do you have. scroll wheel on your mouse?  That’s what we usually use.</p>

<p>Thank you! We do use the scroll wheel on our mouse. Our team was just wondering for when we need to move through a lot of slices quickly if there is a method to do so in the current view for 3D slicer.</p>

<p>Would something like a control-shift-mouse-move work for your use case?</p>

<p>Dear 3D Slicer team,</p>
<p>Thank you for your amazing work.</p>
<p>I would also be interested in such a feature for very fast slice scrolling controlled by mouse dragging in the current view, for instance with control-shift-mouse-move as proposed by pieper.<br>
In other words, it would be a shortcut replacing the use of the “slider” button usually available at the top of the window.</p>
<p>In typical PACS viewers, radiologists can simply hold a “click left” anywhere in the image and then move the mouse up and down to very quickly scroll across all slices.<br>
In 3D slicer, the left click is already reserved to other actions, and I do not suggest changing that. But this is where this “fast scroll by mouse dragging” feature request is coming from.</p>
<p>Thank you again, best,<br>
Alex</p>

<p>Hi,<br>
Was this functionality implemented? For Ctrl + Mouse-Move = slices scrolled.<br>
Maybe something to add in the “<strong>vtkMRMLCameraWidget.cxx</strong>“ file?</p>
