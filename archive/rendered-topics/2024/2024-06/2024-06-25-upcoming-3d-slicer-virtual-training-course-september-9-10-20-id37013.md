<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>Early yesterday morning, at 1 AM Korea Standard Time, just two hours before the scheduled start, <strong>I received an email from Kitware informing me that the course could not proceed as planned.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I must express my disappointment with this sudden decision, especially given the short notice at such an early hour.</strong> Additionally, I have yet to receive a response to the email I sent following this notification, which adds to my concerns.</p>
<p>My team and I had been eagerly anticipating this course for over a month, preparing questions and planning our future work based on the knowledge I hoped to gain.</p>
<p><strong>I am not seeking a refund, but rather, I hope the course can be rescheduled at the earliest convenience, ideally within this month, to continue with my plans.</strong></p>
<p>I value the services Kitware provides and hope that this situation can be resolved promptly, allowing us to maintain a positive and trusting relationship moving forward.</p>
<p>Thank you for your understanding.</p>

<p><a class="mention" href="/u/kyuhoney1103">@kyuhoney1103</a> Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback and express your concerns. We deeply regret the inconvenience caused by the late cancellation of the 3D Slicer virtual training course. We fully understand how disappointing this must have been, especially considering the preparations you and your team made in anticipation of the training.</p>
<p>At Kitware, we take pride in delivering high-quality training and fostering long-term relationships with our community. The decision to cancel was not taken lightly, and we sincerely apologize for the short notice and lack of timely follow-up. We are committed to improving our communication and ensuring that such disruptions are minimized in the future.</p>
<p>Now that you have an account on the Slicer Discourse forum, we encourage you to engage with the vibrant and generous 3D Slicer community. This community helps maintain an extensive collection of training materials and is always available to answer questions. Additionally, we host <a href="https://discourse.slicer.org/c/community/hangout/20">weekly video meetings</a>  where users and developers come together to discuss and answer questions live, usually at 10 AM ET. You can join these sessions by monitoring the Hangout category on the forum, where future events are posted.</p>
<p>We hope this helps bridge the gap in the interim, and we look forward to finding an opportunity to offer you the training experience you had anticipated. Additionally, following the cancellation, a reimbursement was issued, so please don’t hesitate to follow up with <a class="mention" href="/u/nick_bearup">@Nick_Bearup</a> if you have any questions regarding that aspect.</p>
<p>Once again, we apologize for the inconvenience, and we appreciate your understanding as we work to make this right.</p>
