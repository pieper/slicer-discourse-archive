<p>I would like to generate a voxel element that is the size of each pixel (voxel in 3D) and get the densities of each element.<br>
However, I am not quite sure how to do that in SegmentMesher. I played around with the settings for it and I am unable to get the desired voxels nor the mapping per pixel.</p>
<p>Is there a method to do this?</p>
