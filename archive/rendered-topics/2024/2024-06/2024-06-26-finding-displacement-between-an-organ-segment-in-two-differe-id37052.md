<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am trying to quantify the intra-fractional motion of the bladder, rectum and PTVs. I would like to be able to find the center of mass of organ segment, or a repeatable location within a segment, and calculate the displacement between this point at two different times. I have the CT slices and the structure sets of the organs at two different times but I cannot find the CoM or the displacement. Any advice/knowledge is apprecaited. Thank you!</p>
