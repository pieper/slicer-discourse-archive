<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am using Slicer v 5.4.0 and currently trying to compute:</p>
<ol>
<li>cross-sectional area of a vessel</li>
<li>angle of bifurcation</li>
</ol>
<p>I am using the cross-section analysis tool in VMTK but I am not sure if I am doing it correctly. I managed to generate the output table, but not sure which value is correct. Is there a video tutorial available?<br>
As for the angle of bifurcation, I am not sure where to start to approach this. Any help would be greatly appreciated!</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
