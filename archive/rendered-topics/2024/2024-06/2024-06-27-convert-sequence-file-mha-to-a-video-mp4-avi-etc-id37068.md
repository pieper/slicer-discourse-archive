<p>Hello everyone. I have recorded sequences of US scans and I want to have a video file to embed it into my PowerPoint presentation. Does anyone know whether 3D Slicer has such functionality to export a video file?</p>

<p>Try the Screen Capture module for various video creation possibilities.</p>
