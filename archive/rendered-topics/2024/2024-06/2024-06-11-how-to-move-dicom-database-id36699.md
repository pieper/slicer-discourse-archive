<p>I made a beginner error. I moved the SlicerDICOMDatabase in a different location than done by default. Since then no files uploads and I get 0 files…<br>
How can I fix this issue? Thanks</p>

<p>You need to choose a folder that exists and you have write access to. Preferably it should be a real physical drive, not some virtual drive (provided by Google drive, etc.). Folders that have very long path or contain special characters might also cause problems.</p>

<p>Thank you .<br>
I moved the database folder to documents but no luck. Should I reinstall Slicer as I have only a few files saved</p>

<p>Do you see any warning or error messages in the application log?<br>

<p>No. It looks like a normal download but then no files appear.<br>
A friend of mine helped me . Did what you said to do and it now works<br>
Thanks</p>
