<p>How can I find the midpoint of a line?<br>
Is it possible to draw two perpendicular lines?</p>

<p>If you look at the two control points that define the line, and then average them you can find the midpoint of that line.</p>
<p>As far two perpendicular lines, you have to be more specific. perpendicular to what? There are infinite number of perpendicular lines you can draw to the midpoint of a line in 3D.</p>
