<p>how to set Segmentation for a .stl while BranchClipper in VMTK?</p>
<ol>
<li>load a .stl file into 3D Slicer;</li>
<li>Extract Centerlines by VMTK;</li>
<li>while Branch Clipper, it’s not able to set the Segmentation which seems must be set.<br>
Thanks!</li>
</ol>

<p>Right click on the STL model in the ‘Data’ module and convert it to a ‘Segmentation’.</p>
