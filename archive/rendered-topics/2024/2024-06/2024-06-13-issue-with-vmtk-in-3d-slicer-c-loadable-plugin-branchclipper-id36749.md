<p>Hi guys,<br>
I am currently developing a C++ loadable plugin for 3D Slicer and am incorporating VMTK into this project. I’ve successfully built and loaded plugins that do not use VMTK into Slicer without any issues. However, after introducing VMTK into my plugin (I started with an experimental build of the BranchClipper module), even though I can successfully build it (for which I also built VMTK from source), I encounter an error when trying to load it into Slicer. The error message is “the specified procedure could not be found.”</p>
<p>Has anyone faced a similar issue or can provide insights on what might be causing this problem? Any help or guidance would be greatly appreciated as I’m stuck on how to resolve this.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for your assistance!<br>
