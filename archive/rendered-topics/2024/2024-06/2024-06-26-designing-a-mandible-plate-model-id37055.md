<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Im working on a mandible model and Im attempting to design and develop a surgical plate that would act as a perfect fit to my specific model. I have downloaded the ExtraMarkups and Markups to Models extensions to allow the addition of shapes; however, they are limited and do not include the features i need. I was hoping the Markups to Models would convert any markups into a model, however, i believe it only segments a CT/MRI image into a 3D model. I was wondering if there was a feature that I’m unaware of that would aid me in achieving this. If not, would i be able to design the plate in solidworks and somehow load the plate into 3d Slicer?</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

<p>You could try advanced options from BoneReconstructionPlanner extension. It has a titanium plate designer from a markupscurve but it’s not polished</p>
