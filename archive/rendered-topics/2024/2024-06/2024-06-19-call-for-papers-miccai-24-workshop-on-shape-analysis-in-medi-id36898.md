<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p>We gladly announce the workshop for Shape in Medical Imaging (SHAPEMI, <a href="https://shapemi.github.io/">https://shapemi.github.io/</a>) to be held in conjunction with the conference on MICCAI – Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Interventions, in Marrakesh, Morocco, Oct. 6th, 2024.</p>
<p><strong>Aim and Scope</strong></p>
<p>Shape and geometry processing methods are receiving increased attention, notably, in medical imaging.This workshop provide a presentation venue for researchers working in shape and geometrical analysis, such as</p>
<p>shape modeling, geometric learning and statistics. This year’s edition also brings a focus on applications. Original contributions as well as well as exciting applications in medical imaging involving shapes are sought in the form of:</p>
<p>12-15 page full papers</p>
<p>6-11 page short papers</p>
<p>in LNCS style. Accepted papers will be presented at ShapeMI 2024 in the form of posters or oral presentations. Every accepted paper can include a live demo.</p>
<p><strong>Targets topics include, but are not limited to:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Shape Processing and Analysis</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shape Learning and Classification</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Geometric Learning and Manifold-based Methods</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Statistics of Shapes and Deformations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Spectral Shape Analysis</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Spectral Clustering and Dimensionality Reduction</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shape Modeling and Representation</p>
