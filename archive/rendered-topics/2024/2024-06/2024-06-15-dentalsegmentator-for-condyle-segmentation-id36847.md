<p><a class="mention" href="/u/gauthier">@Gauthier</a> thank you so much for this! Finally I can see my condyles in glorious 3D <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/smiley.png?v=12" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>

<p>Hello <a class="mention" href="/u/crosswick">@crosswick</a> !<br>
Is this module also validated for condyle segmentation?<br>
(Please, give the reference of the published article .)</p>

<p>Hello <a class="mention" href="/u/hortakc">@hortakc</a></p>
<p>Thank you for your interest in our work.</p>
<p>So far we haven’t studied specific anatomical parts, only the whole segmentation results. The publication is here: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jdent.2024.105130" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">DentalSegmentator: robust open source deep learning-based CT and CBCT image segmentation</a>  (Journal of Dentistry).</p>
<p>From our experience though, the segmentation of the condyles is efficient in the vast majority of the cases !</p>
<p>Best<br>

<p>Hello <a class="mention" href="/u/gauthier">@Gauthier</a> !<br>
Thanks for the paper title, we are already studying it!</p>
<p>Does the extension require any specific computer configuration for excellent results?</p>
<p>For other segmentation modules, we are using NVidea 4060, 1TB and 64 MB of memory.</p>
<p>I really appreciate your time!<br>
Kindly</p>

<p>Hello <a class="mention" href="/u/hortakc">@hortakc</a></p>
<p>The segmentation results should not impacted by the computer configuration. Only the time needed to process the scan can vary. Your configuration should be largely enough !</p>
<p>Please let us know how your tests go,</p>
<p>Best<br>
Gauthier</p>
