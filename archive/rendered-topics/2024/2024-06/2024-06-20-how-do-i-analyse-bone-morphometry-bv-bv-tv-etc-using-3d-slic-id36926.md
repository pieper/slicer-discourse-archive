<p>I want to analyse microCT scanned bone sample which has a TCP scaffold. I want to analyse the bone growth within the TCP scaffold by evaluating the bone morphometry using 3D slicer? Can anyone please help me with a standard operating protocol for this task? Many thanks for considering my request.</p>
