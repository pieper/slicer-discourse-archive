<p><strong>Background:</strong><br>
Custom development based on 3DSlicer.<br>
Need a common header that displays different page names during screen transitions.</p>
<p>Considering the complexity of C++ development, I would like to develop a common widget using PyQt to be placed in the MainWindow. Therefore, I would like to know:</p>
<p>In the existing code framework of 3DSlicer, can a widget developed with PyQt be loaded and displayed in C++?</p>
