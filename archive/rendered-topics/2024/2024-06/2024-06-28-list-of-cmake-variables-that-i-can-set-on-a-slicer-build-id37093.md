<p>Actually, I’m trying to build the stable release to test changes on stable release extensions that I’m also going to build. I can point the Slicer code folder to branch 5.6 but cmake configuration log still says the release type is “experimental”. Is this an error of cmake?</p>
<p>Could you please answer both questions?</p>
<p>Thanks a lot</p>
