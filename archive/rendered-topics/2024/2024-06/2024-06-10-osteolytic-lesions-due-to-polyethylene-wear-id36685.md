<p>Dear Slicing community :),<br>
Does someone knows how to measure volume of osteolytic lesions due to polyethylene wear of THR, both on acetabular(pelvic) and femoral side?</p>

<p>I guess you would need to have the diagnostics images (MRI, CT, etc), then segment the structures of interest and the use ‘Segment Comparision’ to compare both volumes.</p>
