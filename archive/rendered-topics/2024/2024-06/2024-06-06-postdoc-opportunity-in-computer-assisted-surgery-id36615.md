<p>We are looking for an innovation-minded recent PhD to join our NIH-funded research in the role of a postdoctoral fellow. The project aims to develop a novel visualization and guidance system for laparoscopic procedures. The position will be in the Augmented Reality Surgery Lab, led by Raj Shekhar, PhD, located within the Sheikh Zayed Institute for Pediatric Surgical Innovation at the <a href="https://www.childrensnational.org" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Children’s National Hospital, Washinging, DC</a>.</p>
<p>The ideal candidate will play a key role in driving our laparoscopic augmented reality (AR) research toward developing a clinical system by streamlining hardware and software. This will include working with industrial partners developing custom hardware solutions, developing new software, performing system integration, and conducting laboratory and preclinical testing. The position is hybrid with at least 60% of the work performed on-site.</p>
<p>Responsibilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Apply expertise in computer-assisted surgery, computer vision, image registration, tracking technologies, and software development toward developing the next-generation laparoscopic visualization and guidance system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Collaborate closely with our industrial partners to ensure seamless integration and rigorous testing of the resulting system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Collaboration closely with the clinical partners and conduct experiments with phantoms and employ scientific methods to enhance and characterize system performance.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>PhD in Electrical Engineering, Biomedical Engineering, Computer Engineering or a closely related discipline.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Experience in computer-assisted surgery, computer vision including camera calibration, image processing, tracking technologies, and CAD designs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Proficiency in software development using tools like Visual Studio, OpenCV, and QT.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Peer-reviewed and/or refereed publications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prior experience with working with ultrasound is a plus.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To Apply: Please write to Dr. Shekhar at <a href="mailto:rshekhar@childrensnational.org">rshekhar@childrensnational.org</a> with your CV.</p>
