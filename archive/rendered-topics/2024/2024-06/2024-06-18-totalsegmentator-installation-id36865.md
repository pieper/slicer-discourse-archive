<p>Dear experts,</p>
<p>I just tried to follow the available installation procedure for the TotalSegmentator module. However, when I search for the module inside the Extensions Manager, it doesn’t show up as an option. Has it been temporarily or permanantly removed from the set of available extensions? If not, what might I be doing wrong? I am using Slicer 5.0.3 r30893 / 7ea0f43,</p>
<p>Cheers<br>
Andy</p>

<p>Please use the latest version of Slicer - either stable or preview release.</p>

<p>Thanks for the tip … I was sure that that I was actually using the latest version. Checking that revealed, however, that an older version was installed on my system in addition to the new installation. Long story short: starting 3Dslicer triggered the old version, which led to the problem. Thanks again for waking me up <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/wink.png?v=12" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>
