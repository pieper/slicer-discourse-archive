<p>Operating system: Win 11<br>
Slicer version: 5.6.1<br>
Expected behavior: Merge three Dicom view into one scan<br>
Actual behavior: unable to merge</p>
<p>Hello! I am a newbie. After reading in the forum, I realized merging Dicom views form different volumes is almost impossible. But I would like to know if it is possible when the axial, coronal and saggital views from three volumes have the same spacing, and correspond perfectly to each other. In following photo, I have drag&amp;dropped three different views from three volumes. They correspond and align perfectly but cannot proceed to volume rendering because I dont know how to merge.</p>
