<p>Hi,<br>
I have segmentation of left atrium(LA) for a dataset of 100 patients 3D LGE-MRI.<br>
For a an specific task, I must divide each LA into different regions(e.g. anterior/posterior wall, PVs,…). What is the efficient/standard way to do this over the entire dataset?<br>
I have an idea of having a fixed number of landmarks put on the volume, and then Slicer can divide the volume for me. However, I’m not sure whether Slicer is able to do this or not and whether there is a more standard way?</p>
