<p>Thanks, pieper. This is helpful, but I would like to know how to modify the interface using C++.</p>

<p>You should learn the application first using python - once you know that, everything is basically the same in C++.  If you already know C++ and Qt it won’t be hard, but since most people don’t know C++ it’s much more efficient to start in Python.</p>
