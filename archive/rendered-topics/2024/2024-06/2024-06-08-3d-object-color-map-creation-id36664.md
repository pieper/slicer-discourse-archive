<p>Hello everyone!</p>
<p>Do you know if it is possible to create a deformation map of an object (in my case a human skull) on this software, without going through a segmentation phase?</p>
<p>In fact, I’d like to compare the different zones between 2 skulls, and to do this I perform a fine-tuning recalibration after adding them to the software. I know that it’s then possible to create these maps, but I don’t know how to do this without going through a segmentation phase.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for your feedback!</p>
