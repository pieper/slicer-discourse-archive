<p>You are free to use any parts of Slicer in whole or in part according to the license agreement, which is very open.</p>
<p>Technically though it’s difficult to create, maintain, and distribute a full application like Slicer, so what we suggest and support is creating <a href="https://github.com/KitwareMedical/SlicerCustomAppTemplate">customized</a> versions of Slicer that reuse the existing application framework but create whole new front ends with some functionality added and unused things disabled.</p>
