<p>I’m trying to export each slice’s segmentation to dicom format, downloaded quantitative report extension, but it doesn’t help!</p>

<p>Please do not post the same question mutliple times.</p>
<p>What happens when you right-click on the Segmentation in the Data module and choose “Export as DICOM”?</p>
<p>I don’t use DICOM, so don’t know much, but that seems to work for me.</p>
