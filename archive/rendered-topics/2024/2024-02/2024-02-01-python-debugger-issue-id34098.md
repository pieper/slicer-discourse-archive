<p>I have an issue with trying to use the python debugger module.  I have connected it to Pycharm, that was very easy and the connection seems to be ok.  However, once I make the connection, I can’t get any code to run in Pycharm.  When I go to the Run/Debugging Actions menu, everything is grayed out, except for Pause Program.</p>
<p>I am sure there is something simple I am missing here . . .</p>
<p>Thanks for any thoughts on this</p>
