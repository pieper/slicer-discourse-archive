<p>Hi, there are two labelmap volumes from same source brain atlas that I would like to combine to one for further registration, but they are both having sequential digital labels and I hope to not overwrite in ‘Image labelmap combine’ module. And when I try to modify the digit label number and export the volume, the dimensions amounts were changed, and then combination can not be done. Any idea on better way of processing? Much thanks!!</p>
