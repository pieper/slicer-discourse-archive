<p>I have a problem because I can’t superimpose multiple MRIs.<br>
I’m trying to reconstruct a 3D model of my brain but I have a problem.<br>
I have selected 3 scans with the best resolution but I have to merge them because, for each plane, there is a scan with a higher resolution.<br>
The optimal scan for the frontal plane is the first, for the horizontal plane the second and for the lateral plane the third.</p>
<p>How do I make the program use the scan I prefer only for a specific plan and not for all three?</p>

    Hi, 
I’m working on MRI to segment cheek fat volume and often I have one serie of few images for axial axe, one serie for coronal axe, one serie for sagittal axe (for one patient, one IRM). To get a better volume segmentation I would like to stitch these series. Stitch volume module can help me to match differents axes or it is for differents series of the same axe?
