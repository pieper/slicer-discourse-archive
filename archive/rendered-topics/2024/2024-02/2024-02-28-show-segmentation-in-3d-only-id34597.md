<p>In the Segmentations module you can uncheck “Slice fill” and “Slice outline”, or remove the 2D views from the Advanced → Views section.</p>

To be clear, not all of this is needed. You can disable 2D display, OR you can specify the view in which the segmentation is shown (whatever way it can be).</p>

<p><a class="mention" href="/u/sunderlandkyl">@Sunderlandkyl</a> gave you two ways to do that, not sure what you mean. Please try those. I just wanted to emphasize that you don’t need to do both necessarily, you can do either or.</p>
