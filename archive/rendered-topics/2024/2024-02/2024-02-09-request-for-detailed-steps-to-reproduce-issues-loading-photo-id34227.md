<p>I’m trying to contribute in this project but from the user’s point of view I could not recreate many issues and one of them for example is <a href="https://github.com/Slicer/Slicer/issues/7492" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Fix initialization of MRML node selector linked to parameter node on scene load · Issue #7492 · Slicer/Slicer · GitHub</a> and although it is written here about how to recreate the situation as a user, but unfortunately I let’s say even on point 2 where you need to load 2 photos, could not find such points where and how to do it and therefore simply can not recreate this problem. Can you provide some resources so that I can solve this problem?</p>

<p>Hi:</p>
<p>It would be best to post this request on the Issue that you linked so that the issue creator and anyone else already involved will get a notification.</p>
