<p>I am working on CT and MRI DICOMs with version 5.4.0 in Windows 10 and MacBook Pro Sonoma with no problem. I added on DICOM series and segmentations in MacBook and saved. Then I upgraded to 5.6.1 in both Windows 10 and Sonoma. Then I can open the scene in MacBook, but not in Windows 10. I modified the scene a bit and saved in MacBook with 5.6.1, but still cannot open it in Windows 10.<br>
The error is shown below:<br>

<p>Would you please advise on the solution?<br>
Thanks.</p>

<p>Looks like it might be an issue with end of line characters or something.  Can you try recreating a small example you can share?</p>
