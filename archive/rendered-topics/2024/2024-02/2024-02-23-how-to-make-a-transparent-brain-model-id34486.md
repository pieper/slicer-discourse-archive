<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I’ve recently been having some trouble making a transparent 3D model of the brain to visualize the position of my segmentation of an ablation cavity in the medial temporal area. Any ideas on how to do this? I’ve tried messing around with the Volume render module but the 3D brain model is never quite detailed enough.</p>
<p>Greatly appreciate any help.</p>
