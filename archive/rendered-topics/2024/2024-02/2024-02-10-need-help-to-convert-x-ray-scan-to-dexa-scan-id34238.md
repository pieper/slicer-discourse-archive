<p>Hi, can anyone convert a Xray scan to Dexa Scan file? Thanks!</p>

<p>A Dexa scan uses dual-energy acquisition. If your x-ray image is acquired at a single energy then you cannot distinguish absorption of soft tissues from bones, so you won’t be able to compute bone density accurately.</p>

<p>What’s the next best alternative to turning X-ray scans to see the bones not tissue?</p>
