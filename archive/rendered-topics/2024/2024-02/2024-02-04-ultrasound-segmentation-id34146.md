<p>Hello,<br>
Is it possible to extract radiomic data from ultrasound images? I uploaded and segmented a ROI, but it is not a volume, so that I can not extract features. Is there any other way? Or I should use another soft? Thanks!</p>

<p>You should be able to extract 2D features, but you should research how well radiomics works on US before investing a lot of time in it.</p>
