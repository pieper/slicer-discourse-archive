<p>Dear Slicer Users,<br>
I am not able to install Slicer VR extension for some reason (V 5.6.0)<br>
I add the correct path in App settings but the VR module is not present and visible.<br>
I am affraid that problem is on my side but I can´t figure out what could be wrong…</p>
<p>I would like to kindly ask you for some tip!</p>
<p>Thank you</p>
<p>Lukas</p>

<p>Can you please try the latest preview version? I am not aware of the exact state of the extension, but I know there has been lots of work under the hood in the past months so it would be a good first step to see what does the latest version do.</p>

<p>Thanks a lot.<br>
I confirm, latest preview version works. Also, I see VR module directly in Extensions manager, not necessary to add any path.</p>
<p>…going to try it!<br>
Best regards</p>
<p>Lukas</p>
