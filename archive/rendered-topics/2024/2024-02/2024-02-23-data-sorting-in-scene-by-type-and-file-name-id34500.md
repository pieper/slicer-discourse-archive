<p>As noted in this support thread: <a href="https://discourse.slicer.org/t/sorting-data-by-type-and-name-in-scene/34499" class="inline-onebox">Sorting data by type and name in Scene</a>   I had asked about sorting data in a scene by file type and name. This is not currently supported, but I think it would be a really useful feature for many users. Right now I have almost 100 different items in a scene (models, volumes, closed curves, open curves, points, lines, etc) as I’m working on morphological description of some skulls. I would like to sort them easily by file type and by name. Please consider this as a future update.</p>
