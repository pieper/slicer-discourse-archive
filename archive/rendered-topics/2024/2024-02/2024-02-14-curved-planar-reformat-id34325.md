<p>Just wondering is there a way to map centerline and segmentation that were use to create the CMPR onto itself.</p>

<p>Yes, of course. You can apply the computed Curved Planar Reformat straightening transform to any nodes. If you apply it the centerline then you will see the straightened centerline, if you apply it to the segmentation then you will see the straightened segmentation.</p>

<p>Thank you very much for your fast response.<br>
So I can just apply the transform directly to the segment and centerline.<br>
I am quite new to the program and I just found out about the transforming object just a moment before writing this.</p>
