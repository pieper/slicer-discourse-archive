<p>Dear all,</p>
<p>Recently I finish some cardiac CT images segmentations manually.<br>
When I get the left ventricle , is there any extension that could measue the volume ?<br>
I know that one of the method could be similariy to the simpson biplane used in ultrasound data.<br>
But as to the volume geometry, there maybe some ather methods.<br>
thanks.<br>
whu</p>

<p>You can use the SegmentStatistics module.</p>
