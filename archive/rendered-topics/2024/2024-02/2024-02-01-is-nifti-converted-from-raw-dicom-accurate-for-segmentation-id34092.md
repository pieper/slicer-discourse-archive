# Is Nifti (converted from raw DICOM) accurate for segmentation?

<p>There seems to be a lot of correction performed during the dicom to nifti conversion, such as converting to equal slice thickness and correcting for gantry tilt.</p>
<p>If I perform segmentation on raw DICOMs loaded into Slicer, versus performing segmentation on the converted Nifti versions, are they equally accurate? If there’s any difference, what are they?</p>
<p>Niftis are faster to load, so I would much prefer to distribute nifti to my team rather than the dicom files.</p>
