<p>Hi everyone!</p>
<p>Has anyone had any issues regarding FSL FAST segmentation pipeline; whereby the subcortical (eg thalamus) gets segmented into white matter tissue? I’ve tried to solve this problem by using the N4ITK bias field correction but to no avail. Anyone managed to solve it?</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>
<p>Regards,<br>
Jin</p>
