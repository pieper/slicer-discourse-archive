<p>I’m trying to add seed points before and after a bifurcation to run colliding fronts with VMTK. Let’s say the parent vessel branches into two, branch 1 and branch 2.</p>
<p>I add one seed point in the parent vessel and one in branch 1. However, the resulting surface slightly protrudes into branch 2, which is not really ideal. Has anyone else seen this issue and identified a good way to fix this?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
