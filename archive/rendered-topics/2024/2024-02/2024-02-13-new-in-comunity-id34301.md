<p>hi, im new in this software and in this comunity, my english is bad also. I have lot of questions, some are basical and others more especific. Right now im trying to make a 3d model of my own knee but the series in the MRI have few images. Ther are only 3 series with 25 images each, the others have less (22, 22, 12, 11, and 9). One question i have is: how can i coordinate those 3 series with 25 images each  to make one 3d model without doing each serie separated and after put each stl togeather in other program. Thanks.</p>

Expected behavior: One perfect, high resolution volume 
Actual behavior: Three volumes, each one being high resolution in only one plane (sagittal, coronal, transverse) 
I have been using 3D Slicer for many months and I’m slowly learning the ropes. I am using it to produce anatomical boney models, and have probably created between 10-15 models. 
After loading CT scans from their DICOM folder I always get several volumes, often with the …
