<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I’ve been using Segment Mesher for creating volumetric mesh of a tooth. The default option for saving the vtk file is <strong>binary</strong>. I saw that there is way to save it as <strong>ASCII</strong>, by deactivating option “Compress”. Unfortunately I can’t find where this option. Nor in segment mesher properties window, nor in the window for saving data. Can You please help me find it. Or, if there is another way, please give me hint how to save it as ASCII.</p>
