<p>As part of addressing things toward the upcoming slicer stable 5.8, I’d like to discuss the possible integration of the following PR linked blow that I have had open for awhile. We can discuss the behavior change for placing “Draw” effect points and scrolling to another slice offset.</p>

It is confusing because that single point does not create an visual UI element, so you are left confused that you actually had started drawing on another slice offset. You currently have to right-click to apply (which does nothing because there is &lt;2 points) and then you can draw on the new slice offset. 

This was leading to confusion by our group's users. I have added code so that if you have placed a single point and then scroll to another slice offset, then the draw effect's points are cleared/reset. 

I still think it is a little confusing when there are &gt;1 points and the draw effect goes into a "dashed" line state which is difficult to see. It currently looks like a graphical issue. I would rather the draw effect lines stay the same.</span></p>
