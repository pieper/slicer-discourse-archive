<p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>I am interested in analyzing aortic valves by segmenting the annulus and leaflets, and performing measurements (areas, distances, angles, etc.) using CT imaging. I am wondering if the SlicerHeart module would be suitable for these tasks and where I might find detailed information on how to work with it.</p>
<p>Additionally, I would like the process to be as automated as possible. Is it feasible to use this module via python, or does it require significant human interaction?</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for any guidance!</p>
