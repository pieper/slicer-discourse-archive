<p>Hello 3D Slicer Community,</p>
<p>I am working with two MRI images of a leg—one capturing the upper section and the other covering the lower section. There is an overlap between these two images, but unfortunately, the regions do not align perfectly due to distortion. It seems that the tissue in the overlapped section has either been stretched or squeezed, making it difficult to achieve a smooth stitching.</p>
<p>I would greatly appreciate any guidance on how to approach this problem. My goal is to stitch the two images together, minimizing the distortion in the overlapped area. If you have any suggestions, tools, or workflows within 3D Slicer that could help with this, I would be grateful for your advice.</p>
<p>Thank you very much in advance for your help!</p>
<p>Best regards.</p>
