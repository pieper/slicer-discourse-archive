<p>Hi All,<br>
I am currently working on a project to segment the eustachian tube from CT data. I am attempting to manually label the eustachian tube, but it has been quite challenging to accurately locate and label it.</p>
<p>Does anyone have experience or suggestions on how to label the eustachian tube using 3D Slicer or any other tools?</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>
