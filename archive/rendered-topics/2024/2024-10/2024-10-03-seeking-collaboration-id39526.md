<p>Hello 3D Slicer community!</p>
<p>I’m excited to share that a Respiratory System Biocybernetics Group has officially been established at my university. Our research will focus on algorithms for non-invasive mechanical ventilation and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations of the respiratory system, etc.</p>
<p>We’re planning to use 3D Slicer for preparing 3D models as part of this work. I’d love to know if anyone in the community is interested in collaborating with us or sharing insights on how we can best utilize 3D Slicer for these applications.</p>
<p>Looking forward to connecting with others who might be interested in this area!</p>
<p>Best regards,<br>
Sebastian Meszyński<br>

<p>This sounds great - welcome!</p>
<p>One option for collaboration is to participate in Project Week.  There’s more information at the link below.  The next meeting will be in January in Spain in case you can join, or even join virtually.  It’s a good chance to document your goals, progress, and any issues in order to stimulate collaboration.</p>
