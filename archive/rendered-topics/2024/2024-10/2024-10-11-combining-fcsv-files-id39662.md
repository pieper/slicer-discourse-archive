<p>Hi,<br>
I have been assigning both fixed and semi landmarks to a skull, and I now saved these as a .fcsv file so that I can carry these forward for a GPA/PCA in SlicerMorph.<br>
Given that I have separate semilandmark curves on each suture for analysis, alongside fixed landmarks, there are nine different .fcsv files for each specimen.<br>
Is there a way to combine these into one single .fcsv file for comparison?<br>
Thank you in advance.</p>
