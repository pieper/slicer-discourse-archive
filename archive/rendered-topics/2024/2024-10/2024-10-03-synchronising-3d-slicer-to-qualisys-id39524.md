<p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>I have recently come across information about real-time ultrasonography and the slicerIGT extension. For my research, I need to track joint movement in real-time using a portable ultrasound transducer and a marker-based motion-tracking system. I am currently seeking a method to synchronize the marker data in Qualisys Track Manager and 3D Slicer. Can anyone guide me on how to achieve this?</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>
