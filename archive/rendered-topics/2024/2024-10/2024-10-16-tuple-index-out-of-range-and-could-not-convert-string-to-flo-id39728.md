<p>I was hoping to use the Musculoskeletal Analysis Extension, specifically the Density Analysis function, for a project, but I’m having trouble getting it to run in practice tests.<br>
When I run the Density Analysis on the extension’s sample dataset following the instructions, I get a “could not convert string to float” error. When I try to run the module using the dataset provided by 3D Slicer, I get a “tuple index out of range” error.<br>
Has anyone encountered these issues before, and are there any solutions available?<br>
Thank you all for your time!<br>
Slicer version: 5.6.2<br>
Operating system: macOS Monterey</p>
