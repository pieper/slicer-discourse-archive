<p>Hello 3D slicer community. I have an stl file of a mouse phantom (half of the phantom) and I need to extract the contour of the bottom edge of the phantom and export it as BMP, JPG, PNG, I need the actual dimensions to be maintained as I need the contour to laser cut some gafchromic films, that will be later place within the phantom. Could you please advise?<br>
Thank you<br>
Ileana</p>
