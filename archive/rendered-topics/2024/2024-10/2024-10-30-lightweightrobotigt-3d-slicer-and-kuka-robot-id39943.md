<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>I have some questions in regards to this slicer extension: <a href="https://github.com/SNRLab/LightWeightRobotIGT" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">GitHub - SNRLab/LightWeightRobotIGT</a></p>
<p>From my understanding, this extension used to be hosted on the Midas-based server that the older version of 3D Slicer used to access packages (before version 4.4.0). It seems as though the extension is not available on the newer package host (<a href="http://slicer.kitware.com" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">slicer.kitware.com</a>).</p>
<p>I was wondering if this is indeed the case, and if maybe there is actually a version of this but under a different name? Or, has  anyone tried to rebuild the extension locally?</p>
<p>In the event that I will rebuild the extension, I need to rebuild 3D Slicer as well right?</p>
<p>Does anyone have an input or experience connecting 3D Slicer with a KUKA robot recently? Note, we are enable to use ROS2.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>
Marie</p>
