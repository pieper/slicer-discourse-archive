<p>Hello all!</p>
<p>I’m researching the segmentation and canal-type classification for the second mesial-buccal canal. My dataset consists of NIfTI files containing the teeth I want to classify. Some of these canals are obturated, causing artifacts in the images.</p>
<p><img src="https://us1.discourse-cdn.com/flex002/uploads/slicer/original/3X/c/8/c8f43f21874d586c54fcac2ca465c870a653e820.png" alt="image" data-base62-sha1="sFIMYRSC85hYqAi4ClY3tGjwYz6" width="517" height="370"></p>
<p>I’m only familiar with the segmentation tools offered by Slicer, and I’m looking to reduce the intensity of these obstructions to reduce the artifacts caused by them.</p>
<p>Any help on this would be appreciated. Thanks!</p>
