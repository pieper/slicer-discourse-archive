<p>Hello<br>
I’m trying to use the pivot and the spin caliberation in the igt model, at first it worked fine but now it stopped working, do you have any idea what am I doing wrong?<br>
I’m working with a needle model and a NDI aurora tracker via plus</p>

<p>Without more details, we can only guess.</p>
<p>My guess would be that the needle is already calibrated.</p>
<p>If you think that the problem is something else then please describe what you did, what you expected to happen, and what happened instead. Provide a screenshot of the transform tree (Data module, Transform hierarchy tab), a screenshot of the Pivot calibration module, and your Plus device set configuration file.</p>
