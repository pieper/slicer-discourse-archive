<p>A colleague of mine needs to use this extension, and it appears that it hasn’t been functioning since v5.0.3. I tried to download that specific release, but the extension catalogue is empty (no extensions are shown).</p>
<p>There are bunch of issues on the repo, some of which are couple years old. This is listed under Kitware, so I am not sure who is responsible for it…</p>

We will look into it.</p>

<p>Hi Murat, we have released an updated version of the Bone Texture Extension and addressed several of the issues/bugs on the repo. It now supports the latest version of Slicer and can be installed from the extension manager using the Preview release of Slicer. Please see our recent blog post for more details: <a href="https://www.kitware.com/introducing-the-updated-bone-texture-extension-for-simplified-image-texture-analysis-in-3d-slicer/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://www.kitware.com/introducing-the-updated-bone-texture-extension-for-simplified-image-texture-analysis-in-3d-slicer/</a>. We would love to hear your feedback once you or your colleagues have tested out the updated extension.</p>
