<p><code>QuickAlign</code> module in SlicerMorph allows you to orient two different objects (models, volumes, markups etc), in two separate 3D viewers, and then link the views, so that their relative positions remains the same.</p>
<p>See the tutorial at: <a href="https://github.com/SlicerMorph/Tutorials/tree/main/QuickAlign" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Tutorials/QuickAlign at main · SlicerMorph/Tutorials · GitHub</a></p>
