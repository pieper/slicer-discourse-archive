<p>Hi</p>
<p>I want to install package in slicer for my plugin, How to do it, As I was using PythonSlicer.exe for installing packages is it the right way . As I could see slicer version 5.2.2 and 5.6.2 both are having PythonSlicer.exe python version as 3.9.10 . How to get the latest version of python</p>
