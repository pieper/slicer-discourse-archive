<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I am still learning how to use Python console to automatically process my data. I would like to ask if there is any script recorder stuff in 3D slicer, I mean I can click the button firstly, and then it shows the corresponding python scripts so that I can dig into that and revise.<br>
I know there are a lot of examples but still feel it is a bit difficult for me.</p>
<p>Best regards,<br>
Chuan</p>

<p>There’s nothing automatic, but these methods work:</p>
