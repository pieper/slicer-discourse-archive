<p>I am trying to place markers (points) on 3D surfaces. I can place the markers anywhere I want and they will not snap to the surfaces in the 3D view. They will also not move with the associated surfaces, even if I move the marker list under the same transform as the surface in the Transform hierarchy.</p>
<p>I am running slicer 5.7.0-2024</p>

<p>Which version of 5.7.0 are you using? And what markup type are you working with I can’t replicate what you describe in mine from October 11 (r33056) on MacOS using pointList.</p>
<p>Same with the transforms. If they are under the same transform, the markup and the model move together.</p>
