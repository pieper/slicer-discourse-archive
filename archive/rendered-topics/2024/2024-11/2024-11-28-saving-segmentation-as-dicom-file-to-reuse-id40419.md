<p>Hello Comunity,</p>
<p>I want to save my segmentation into a DICOM file.<br>
I have 128 slices of h,w = 128. I am using 3D slicer to segment and select my VOI, my objective is to save the selected regions into a DICOM files so that I can apply them to my data as a mask for example !<br>
I try saving it from the Data section, however, it generates a dicom file where image data are of shape (1369, 2560, 3), which is not good!</p>
