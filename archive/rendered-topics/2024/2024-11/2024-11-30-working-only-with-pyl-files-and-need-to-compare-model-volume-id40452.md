<p>Hello! I am a complete beginner for 3D Slicer, so sorry if my post is redundant or you have already treated this topic. I have experience with other softwares for cellular imaging but it is the first time I need to work with 3D models.</p>
<p>I would like some help in understanding how to use the software specifically if you need to compare volumes obtained from an intraoral scanner which gives me two different pyl files (pre-op and post-op).</p>
<p>Can you redirect me to any specific thread where this has been discussed or tutorial that I could follow? I find a lot of information on how to segment images from CBCT scans or MRIs, but I need only to work on the models unfortunately.</p>
<p>What I understood so far is: I need to align the two models and I downloaded the CMF Fiducial Surface Registration tool for it. I am following a youtube tutorial (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsZrjNsXZbs" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsZrjNsXZbs</a>) but for some reason when I try to add landmarks on the fixed and moving models it only allows me to add one on each model and if I try to add other points it simply moves the first ones.</p>
<p>The second problem I think I might have even after aligning the models is that I am using ply files and I don’t have vtk files, thus Slicer does not recognize any Volume but only the two models. I was looking at this tutorial (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qen8ou5QsAw" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qen8ou5QsAw</a>) and VTK files seem necessary to go on with the analysis. So, is it possible to create volumes from the two models?</p>
<p>The best could be to discuss with some experts directly on Zoom, but I am open to any way of getting more info.</p>
<p>Thanks so much to anyone who will answer!</p>
