<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I am trying to use this model “Wholebrainseg large unest segmentation” (from here <a href="https://monai.io/model-zoo.html" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">MONAI Model Zoo</a>) in MONAI Auto3D Seg in Slicer 3D. I put it in the correct path according to Github (<a href="https://github.com/lassoan/SlicerMONAIAuto3DSeg" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">GitHub - lassoan/SlicerMONAIAuto3DSeg: Extension for 3D Slicer for running MONAI Auto3DSeg models</a>), which is “C:\Users\Myname.MONAIAuto3DSeg\models\wholeBrainSeg_Large_UNEST_Segmentation_v0.2.3”. It still doesn’t show up in Slicer. I still don’t see it. I see the default segmentation models. Also, when I go to the module and click the models cache button it brings me to the correct folder (see path above). It doesn’t make sense to me.</p>
<p>Do I have to manually path this model? How would I do that?</p>
<p>Thanks for your help!</p>
