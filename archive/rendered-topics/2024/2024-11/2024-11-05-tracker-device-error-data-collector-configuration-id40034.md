<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>I’m attempting to perform spatial calibration with the PLUS Toolkit, but I keep running into issues, and I’m not entirely sure why.</p>
<p>Initially, I suspected that the problem was due to the NDI Polaris Spectra not detecting the “Tool” marker properly. The logs seem to suggest this might be the case, as shown in the screenshot below:</p>
<p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://us1.discourse-cdn.com/flex002/uploads/slicer/original/3X/f/4/f4e49d071f0de1f85c8ca1082373964619b886e9.png" data-download-href="/uploads/short-url/yWqiTkX9lVGW4WjacBzkA0a4nBn.png?dl=1" title="image" rel="noopener nofollow ugc"><img src="https://us1.discourse-cdn.com/flex002/uploads/slicer/original/3X/f/4/f4e49d071f0de1f85c8ca1082373964619b886e9.png" alt="image" data-base62-sha1="yWqiTkX9lVGW4WjacBzkA0a4nBn" width="690" height="291" data-dominant-color="FAE9E5"><div class="meta"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use href="#far-image"></use></svg><span class="filename">image</span><span class="informations">1868×788 86.4 KB</span><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use href="#discourse-expand"></use></svg></div></a></div></p>
<p>However, after looking into it further, I think it might be related to buffer settings or data handling, which I’m still getting familiar with in PLUS.</p>
<p>I recorded a video showing the process in action, including the errors that come up during calibration. If anyone has experienced similar issues or has tips on improving buffer or data settings in PLUS, your advice would be greatly appreciated!</p>

<p>Thanks in advance for any help!</p>
