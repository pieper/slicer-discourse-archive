<p>Hi! I am having trouble with my segment editor module. I have my segmentations highlighted of my ct data of a primate tooth and can see all of them in the 2D screens. But everytime I press the “show in 3D” button, nothing happens and later it eventually crashes.<br>
Could this be a memory issue? Or is it incompatible with my computer? I have been able to do this on other PCs.</p>

<p>yes, probably a memory issue.  Try the same steps with other data and/or changing the segment geometry or cropping the volume.</p>
