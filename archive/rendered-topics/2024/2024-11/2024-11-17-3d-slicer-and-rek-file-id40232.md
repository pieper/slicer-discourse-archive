<p>Dear all,</p>
<p>I got a CT scan in the form of a single rek. file. I am unable to open in the Slicer. Is there any way to open/convert this data so I would be able to work on this scan in the Slicer?<br>
Presumably this file type can be opened in the Dragonfly, so I guess it may be also possible in case of the 3D Slicer.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>
