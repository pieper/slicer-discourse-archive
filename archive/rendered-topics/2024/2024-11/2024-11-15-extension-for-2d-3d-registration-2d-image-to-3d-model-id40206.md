<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I would like to apply a 2D-3D registration and was wondering if there is any extensions within 3D Slicer that can do this? Our case is to register a 2D image (e.g. 2D cerebral angiograms to a 3D model) to a 3D model (segmented from 3D volume).</p>
<p>This paper is for context of what I am hoping for:</p><aside class="onebox allowlistedgeneric" data-onebox-src="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6507588">
