<p>Hi guys!</p>
<p>I have a STL Design, which I voxelized with a python script into a .nrrd, and assigned density +attenuation coefficients to filled and non filled voxels. How can I use this now to create a DRR like projection? I want to simulate a Mammography with about 28 keV and looked up the attenuation coefficients for my tissue of interest and fat, aswell as the respective densities. I loaded the .nrrd file into 3D slicer as a volume. How shall I proceed from here?</p>
<p>Here is the link of a similiar post I found about this topic and an image of my “simple projection” of the STL file:</p>

Hi Guys!  Although this is an older topic I thought I give it a try since I have a similiar question: 
The uploaded picture is an orthographic projection of a STL Design I did, which shall mimic a female breast parenchym in Mammography. I created the projection using an orthographic projection script in python. 
So much for the introduction, now here is my problem: I want to use 3D slicer to create a more advanced orthographic projection, like a DRR. I have voxeli…

<p>Thank you for your help!</p>
