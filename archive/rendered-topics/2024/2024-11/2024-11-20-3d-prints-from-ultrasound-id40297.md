<p>Good afternoon,<br>
I perform ultrasounds of babies in my practice. Currently I have a partner who makes 3D prints of my ultrasounds but since I want to invest in a 3D printer I want to be able to print them myself. Only I don’t know how to convert the files. The partner who makes the prints today obviously wants to keep this to himself.</p>
<p>I can export from my Samsung device the files as DICOM but when I open them I get an mvl file. How can I convert these to a printable file? Thanks in advance for your help.</p>
