<p>Hi all,<br>
I just wanted to clarify something, when creating semilandmark patches, are you limited to the first 100 markup points to define the semilandmark grid points? As I can only enter grid points up to 100.</p>

<p>That’s the control points for grid. So 100 will give you 100x100 sampling grid, for a total o 10,000 semiLMs.</p>
<p>I wouldn’t suggest doing that.</p>
