<p>Hello, could someone help me? I need to be able to download version 5.7.0-2024-09-05 of Slicer, as I am splitting the work between two different devices and would like both to have the same version. Thank you in advance.</p>

<p>Not all preview versions are maintained. For example<br>
<code>https://download.slicer.org/?offset=-35</code></p>
<p>Shows the build from 9/5 for windows but not for Mac. You can try offseting one or two more days up and down.</p>
<p>Regardless, Slicer is fully portable. You can copy and paste one existing installation to another device (provided they are the same operating system of course).</p>
