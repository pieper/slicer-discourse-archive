<p>Hello<br>
I’m navigating in a heart model with a cathether and I’m using a STL file of the heart model in 3d slicer.<br>
right now im using a low opacity of the model to see what im doing, and I wanted to know if there is a way to cut the STL in the 3d slicer , so we could see better what we are doing.<br>
that would really help us<br>
thank you again for all your previous help.<br>
Maya</p>

<p>You can use the Plane cut or ROI cut tools in the Dynamic Modeler module. Or you can clip the model using a slice plane in the Models module.</p>
<p>FYI a completely revamped clipping feature will be implemented in Slicer soon, and I suggest using that once it is released.</p>

<p>Thank you so much. I will try what you suggested until the release of the new module.</p>
