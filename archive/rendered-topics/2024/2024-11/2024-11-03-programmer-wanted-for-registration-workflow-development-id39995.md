<p>Hello all,</p>
<p>We are looking for a freelancer or dedicated programmer for our slicer based navigation system development.</p>
<p>Currently we require to implement the following task:</p>
<p>The task:</p>
<p>We need to implement a new Registration workflow in 3D Slicer. The registration workflow should register a Pre Op CT to 2 IntraOp Fluro X-Rays.</p>
<div class="youtube-onebox lazy-video-container" data-video-id="I_XjU1t-RrQ" data-video-title="CT/C-arm Image Registration (New Version)" data-video-start-time="" data-provider-name="youtube">
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_XjU1t-RrQ" target="_blank" class="video-thumbnail" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">
    <img class="youtube-thumbnail" src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/I_XjU1t-RrQ/maxresdefault.jpg" title="CT/C-arm Image Registration (New Version)" width="690" height="388">
  </a>
</div>

<p>User journey:<br>
• Ask user to take 2 fluro shots. 1 in AP and 1 in oblique (or lateral, whichever suits to design algorithm)<br>
• Use it to match. Matching can be automatic or semi automatic<br>
Specifications/Acceptance criteria:<br>
• The workflow should be implemented in 3D Slicer<br>
• The workflow components should be implemented in a way they can work as independent slicer modules<br>
• The workflow should support performing all tasks manually<br>
• The workflow should include calibration/image distortion of the image distortion of the C-Arm.</p>
<p>Please reach out so we can discuss the implementation and financials further.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Hi Varun,<br>
This sounds like an interesting project. I’ve worked quite a bit with 3D Slicer.</p>
<p>Implementing that CT to X-ray registration workflow should be doable.</p>
<p>Happy to chat more about the specifics.</p>
<p>You can reach out to me on my <a href="mailto:colinwilliams8254@gmail.com">email here</a></p>

<p>The proposed approach shows certain similarities to the registration workflow of a commercial spine surgery robot that I have previously used. In that system, the C-arm is first calibrated, and a dedicated fiducial grid module is mounted on the image intensifier. May I ask how your project is progressing? I am also very interested in conducting research in this direction.</p>
