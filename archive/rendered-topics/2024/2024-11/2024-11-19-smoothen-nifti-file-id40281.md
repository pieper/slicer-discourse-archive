<p>Hello</p>
<p>I noticed that when we open a NIFTI file in Slicer, it automatically applies a transformation to the mesh and make it smooth. I would like to know if we can access this feature through Python code? And what is the algorithm used behind?</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for your response<br>
Bests</p>

<p>Maybe you are talking about loading a binary mask that was saved as NIFTI, and loading it as a segmentation? Then the answers to your questions are here: <a href="https://discourse.slicer.org/t/how-does-create-closed-surface-representation-work/40185/2" class="inline-onebox">How does create closed surface representation work ? - #2 by cpinter</a></p>
