<p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>I’m writing a Python script for 3D Slicer that needs to be executed in a 32-bit Python version. However, as far as I know, there is no 32-bit version of 3D Slicer.</p>
<p>Does anyone have any ideas on how I could make this work?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>We dropped 32-bit support many years ago. I would recommend to update your environment, or build a 32-bit Slicer package yourself, or communicate with 3D Slicer via slicerio Python package.</p>
