<p>What kind of VR is best for Slicer?<br>
I tried using google cardboard, the effect is interesting but usability is poor.<br>
I’m looking for another solution, good and not too expensive <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"><br>

<p>Cardboard and other generic cellphone-based headsets are practically useless because they don’t have 3D controllers. Probably the Meta Quest 2 headset is the cheapest solution that you can get and it should be compatible with Slicer, but <a href="https://www.meta.com/help/quest/articles/headsets-and-accessories/oculus-link/connect-with-air-link/">you need to have a proper GPU to use Meta Quest Link</a> (and I haven’t tried it myself).</p>

<p>Upvote for the Meta Quest 2. Although I do not use it too often, because the VR interface is still very basic. I have an RTX 3070 TI on my desktop.</p>
