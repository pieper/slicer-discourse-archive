<p>And there are tutorials at the SlicerDMRI docs page <a href="http://dmri.slicer.org/docs/" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Documentation</a><br>
Going through those in order, it should eventually take you through the steps of DTI tractography and later UKF 2-tensor based tractography.</p>
