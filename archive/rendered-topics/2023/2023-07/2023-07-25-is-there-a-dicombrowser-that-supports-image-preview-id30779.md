<p>I saw someone’s dicombrowser or dicom module with image preview on the forum before, but I couldn’t find similar features in the slicer plugin today,Do we have this type of extension？</p>

<p>Note you can also see a thumbnail in the current preview release by right clicking and picking View Metadata from the menu (the images are shown before sorting but you can see what they look like).</p>

<p>You have version 5.2.1 there.  You need to use a newer version (the latest preview has it, maybe 5.2.2, I don’t recall for sure).</p>
