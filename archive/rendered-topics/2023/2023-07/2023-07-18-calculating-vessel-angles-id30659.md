<p>Hello! I tried to use slicer to make reconstruction of intracranial vessels.<br>
After I received the models, I would like to know the angles between the vessels at the bifurcation point.<br>
Are there any way I can access to these information?<br>
The models I have received are mostly like this:<br>

I would like to measure the angles between two vessels.<br>
Thanks a lot!!</p>
<p>Operating system: Windows 10<br>
Slicer version: 5.0.3</p>
