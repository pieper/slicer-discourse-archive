<p>I am wondering how to increment/decrement the current slice across all views (Sagittal, Coronal, Axial) simultaneously. Linking views only works if they are all in the same view, I’d like to have it be that they all increment across each window.</p>

<p>Hold down Shift key while moving the mouse over a slice viewer.</p>
