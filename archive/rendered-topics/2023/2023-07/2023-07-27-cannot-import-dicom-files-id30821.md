<p>I am trying to import a DICOM file so I can turn it into a NRRD file to convert to a STL. When I attempt to add the DICOM folder I get this error</p>
<p>W: DcmSequenceOfItems: Reached end of stream before the end of sequence PixelData (7fe0,0010)<br>
Could not load  “C:/Users/warre/OneDrive/Documents/BrainScan/DICOM/23072518/56430000/87426690”<br>
DCMTK says:  Sequence Delimitation Item missing<br>
Could not read DICOM file:C:/Users/warre/OneDrive/Documents/BrainScan/DICOM/23072518/56430000/87426690</p>
