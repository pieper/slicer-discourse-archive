    Any kind of non-networking task (e.g., starting a segmentation task) initiating network communication without explicit user approval could be interpreted by some users as spying. Users that are sensitive about tracking their activities install firewalls that immediately notify them about all network requests and they are upset if they find out that a software attempted to send information without consent, may start a smear campaign, etc. that we should all absolutely avoid.
