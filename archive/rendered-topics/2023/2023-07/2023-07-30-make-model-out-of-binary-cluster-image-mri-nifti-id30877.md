<p>Hello,<br>
I am new to 3D slicer, I would like to know if there is a way to make a 3D model out of a (binary) fmri-cluster-image I got from FSL?<br>
Thank you in advance!</p>

<p>You can load a binary image as segmentation, by selecting <code>Segmentation</code> in the <code>Description</code> column in the “Add data” window.</p>
