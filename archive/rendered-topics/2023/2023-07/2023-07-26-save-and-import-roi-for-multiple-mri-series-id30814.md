<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I am new to using 3D slicer. For a project I want to crop a 400x400 pixel ROI box from axial MRI scans and export them as DICOM. I managed to do it for one patient’s MRI series, but I need to have the exact same ROI box for the next patient. I have exported the ROI as a .json file, but when I quit and reopen 3D slicer it won’t load it as a volume. It will load it as markup but then it loads the ROI box rotated. Moreover, it does not layer over my axial scans correctly.</p>
<p>Can anyone help me with this or know another way to do it?</p>
<p>Best,<br>
Ed</p>
