<p>Hello, I am conducting a software research on medical image feature extraction.In order to extract medical image features, the depicted ROI should contain at least how many voxels？<br>

<p>It entirely depends on what features you want to extract for what purpose.</p>

<p>We wonder if it’s possilble to extract small lesion features(like 10 voxels) extracted from the sketched CT image,thx for your reply</p>

<p>By the way, I have got a tip from LIFEx’s  documents that “The ROI should include at least 64 voxels for 3D ROl and 16 voxels for 2D ROl”; And this topic is connected with our cooperation with a hospital for extraction of small volume lesions by some feature extraction softwares</p>
