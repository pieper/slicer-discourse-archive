<p>Dear community,</p>
<p>I have MRI dataset that has been outlined in clinical radiotherapy software to produce RTSS. I have converted the image and contours to NRRD format using the BatchStrutureSetConversion script. I am keen to explore smaller areas of the tumours using radiomics. I am currently running Pyradiomics in Batch processing mode from command line. Is it possible to</p>
<ol>
<li>Get features on a slice by slice basis? (So if x slices in image set to generate x sets of radiomics data)</li>
<li>Split masks into subregions of n pixels x n pixels and analyse each subregion separately?</li>
</ol>
<p>(Disclaimer: I’m a clinician and not very code savvy!)</p>
<p>Thank you for your help in advance!</p>
