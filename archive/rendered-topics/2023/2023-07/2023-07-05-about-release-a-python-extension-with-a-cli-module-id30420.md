<p>Hi 3D Slicer Community,</p>
<p>We are developing a Python extension and plan to release it into the 3D slicer community.  To make the main time-consuming part run in the backend, we create a CLI module following this repo: <a href="https://github.com/lassoan/SlicerPythonCLIExample" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">GitHub - lassoan/SlicerPythonCLIExample: Example extension for 3D Slicer that demonstrates how to make a Python script available as a CLI module</a>.</p>
<p>I am wondering when we prepare the extension repo in GitHub, what should we do with this Python CLI module?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
