<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I loaded my dicom files in 3D slicer, but it showed “import completed: added 0 patients, 0 studies, 0 series, 0 instances.” I’m not sure what’s going on here. The software was opening fine with my previous DICOM files. Any suggestions? Many thanks.</p>

<p>Have you created the DICOM database and is it in a writable location?<br>
You may get some hints about what went from messages in the application log.</p>
