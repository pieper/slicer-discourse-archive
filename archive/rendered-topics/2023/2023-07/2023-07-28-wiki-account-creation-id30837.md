<p>Hello, I have been working on the TCIA Browser extension for the past couple of weeks, and I would like to update the wiki page for the extension. I requested an account, but I have not received the confirmation email yet.</p>

<p>The Slicer wiki has been deprecated and the content is being migrated to either readthedocs or the github wiki.  Probably best to document your extension in the github repo.  This is what many extensions do.</p>
