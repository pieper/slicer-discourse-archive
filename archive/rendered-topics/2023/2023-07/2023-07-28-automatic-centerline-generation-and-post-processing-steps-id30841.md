<p>Hi all,<br>
I have a stl file for a bifurcation case (along the Z axis). I want to generate the centerline for this geometry.<br>
In the next step, I want to create the boundary planes perpendicular to this centerline (on the user-defined z coordinates)<br>
and in the last step, I want to extrude the geometry in the direction of the centerline vector on these slices (adding the flow extensions) with the user-defined value in z direction</p>
<p>Is this doable in 3D Slicer?<br>
Could you please help with the required steps?</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
