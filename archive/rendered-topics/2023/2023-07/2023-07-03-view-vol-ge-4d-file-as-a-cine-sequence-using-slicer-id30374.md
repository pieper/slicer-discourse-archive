<p>Operating system: windows 10<br>
Slicer version:5.2.1<br>
Expected behavior: I am working with GE .vol Kretz file. I am using the GE 4D viewer to view it as a cine file. I have loaded the file in Slicer<br>
and exported it to .vtk format and rendered it as a 3D volume. So right now I am getting only one instance of the 4D data. What I want is to get each instance of the 4D data so that I can I can put a time loop on all the 3D volumes and view it as a 4D file on my application.<br>
Actual behavior: How can I do this in Slicer?</p>
