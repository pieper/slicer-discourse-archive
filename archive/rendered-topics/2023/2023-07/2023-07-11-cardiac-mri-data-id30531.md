<p>Hello, I am working on 3D cardiac MRI images, I want to do normalization for my images. As for now, I used the general normalization script such as<br>
def normalize(x, max_value):<br>
x[x&gt;max_value]=max_value<br>
return x/max_value</p>
<p>Do you have any suggestions about others methods which is more proper for this case? Thank you</p>
