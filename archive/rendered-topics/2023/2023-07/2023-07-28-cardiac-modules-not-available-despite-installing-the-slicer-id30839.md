<p>I installed the Slicer Heart (by downloading it to my PC from the extension catalog website then installing it from my PC to the Slicer 5.2.2), however, I cannot find any of the cardiac modules in the modules drop list. Of note, after I had the Slicer Heart extension module installed, the restart button remained grayed out, so I couldn’t restart Slicer this way. But I did close it and logged back in many times, still I could not find the cardiac modules. I specifically need the Philips 4D US DICOM patcher for my fellow’s research. Please let me know what’s the best way to fix this.</p>
