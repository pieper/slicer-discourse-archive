<p>Operating system:<br>
Slicer version: 5.2.2<br>
Expected behavior:<br>
Actual behavior:</p>
<p>I have question regarding drawing 11 ROIs  around the Catphan phantom, but im wondering:</p>
<ol>
<li>Is it necessary to draw a background around ROI? If so, could you please guide me on how to do it effectively?</li>
<li>Is it required to draw the ROIs to cover the entire area 100%, or can there be some areas that are partially missing? I would like to know if this would have any impact on the resulting analysis.</li>
</ol>
<p>Thank you in advance for your valuable support and guidance.</p>
<p>Waleed</p>
