<p>When we want to update the source code of any extension, we use the EDIT button. When the button is pressed, a code editor installed on the computer is activated and the relevant code is opened. Unfortunately, when I press the EDIT button, the code editor does not open. Nothing happens.</p>

<p>Slicer opens the the .py file in the program that is specified in operating system settings. If you want to use a different program (e.g., because when you installed Python you chose to associate .py files with the Python launcher) then you can <a href="https://discourse.slicer.org/t/editor-for-py-files-is-now-configurable/30563">specify an editor in the Slicer application settings</a>. This feature is only available in latest Slicer Preview Releases.</p>
