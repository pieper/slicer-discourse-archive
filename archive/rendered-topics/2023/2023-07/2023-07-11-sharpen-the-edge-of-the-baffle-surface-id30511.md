<p>As <a class="mention" href="/u/cpinter">@cpinter</a> suggested above, please keep the discussion in English. You can add the translation source in another language in addition to the English translation if you are not sure that the translation captured all details correctly. Each post is written by 1 person and on average it is read by over 100 people. Therefore, we can reduce the amount of time spent with translation by 100x if the author translates and not the readers.</p>
