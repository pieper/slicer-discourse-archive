<p>Hello - I am working on segmenting bones from a CT scan. I have the preview set to the desired threshold range but it all disappears after clicking “apply.” I am working on 3D slicer 5.2.2, all extensions are disabled. I have watched dozens of tutorials, and have yet to find a solution to this issue.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Maybe this documentation section will help explaining what’s happening and what to do about it: <a href="https://slicer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/modules/segmenteditor.html#cannot-paint-outside-some-boundaries" class="inline-onebox">Segment editor — 3D Slicer documentation</a></p>
