<p>Dear support,<br>
I need to create a segmentation of thoracic tac in which a cardiac device (cardiac pacemaker) is placed.<br>
I performed total segmentation with TotalSegmentation Extension but I obtained only the specific anatomical regions.<br>
In a render view as CT-Muscle, I visualized the pacemaker, muscle and skin.<br>
Which is the best way to also segment the muscle where the cardiac device will be positioned and the cardiac device too?<br>
Is there a way to get the volume of a render like what you get from CT-Muscle rendering?<br>
Thanks</p>
