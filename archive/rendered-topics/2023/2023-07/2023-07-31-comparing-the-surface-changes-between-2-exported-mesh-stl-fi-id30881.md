<p>Operating system: Windows 11<br>
Slicer version:<br>
Expected behavior:<br>
Actual behavior: 5.2.2</p>
<p>Hello everyone, I am a new user of Slicer. I am medical student and I do not have many experiences with the software. I am investigating the changes of the surfaces, then quantify it (by measuring volume, surface area). So could you let me know the procedure to do it. I also searched on the forum and on youtube but I am still confusing about the steps.<br>
Thank you very much for your support.</p>
