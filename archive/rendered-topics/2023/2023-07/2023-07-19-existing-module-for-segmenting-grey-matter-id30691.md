<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I wish to segment the grey matter in the brain in Slicer. I was wondering if there is a way to segment that using any module?</p>
<p>Slicer version that I am using -  4.11</p>

<p>You can search for SynthSeg either here (e.g. <a href="https://discourse.slicer.org/t/beginner-issues-segmenting-brain-to-stl-for-3d-print/29040/2">this post</a>) on on google.  It’s a very robust way to do brain segmentation.</p>
