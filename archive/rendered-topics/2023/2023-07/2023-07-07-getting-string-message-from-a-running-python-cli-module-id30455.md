<p>Hi Slicer Community,</p>
<p>I have developed a Python CLI module to make the most time-consuming part run in the backend. I can use the XML syntax to get its progress. However, I also want to get some string information (e.g., the scan upload is finished) from the CLI, I searched the source code, but it seems that there is no way I can do this. Do you have some suggestions on this?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
