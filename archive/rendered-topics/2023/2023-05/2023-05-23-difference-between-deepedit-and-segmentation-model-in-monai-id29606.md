<p>I have to do the segmentation of the brain from the CTA data. I choose MONAI Label for that, and I am using the Monai extension in the 3D slicer. I have gone through all the lecture videos on YouTube as well as the documentation, but I couldn’t find in which case which model would be better to use. To my knowledge, the Segmentation model was introduced later in Monai, so I couldn’t find much about it. DeepEdit model uses either UNETR or DynUNet network while the segmentation model uses SegResNet network. But I don’t know how they work. Before I start looking at them in deep, can someone tell me the differences in using those models in the Monai label for segmentation, especially for brain CTA?</p>
