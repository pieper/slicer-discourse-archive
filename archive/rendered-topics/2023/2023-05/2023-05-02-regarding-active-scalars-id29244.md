<p>Hello!</p>
<p>Can anyone help me with how can I monitor what active scalars can be calculated for the centerline model in VMTK extension. I am getting only 3 options, but my interest lies in the calculation of curvature, torsion, and tortuosity, which are not there in the drop down list. Can anyone help me with how can I include the option of more geometrical indices in it?</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

    Hello! 
I am trying to calculate the geometric indices such as curvature, torsion and tortuosity from the extracted centrelines in 3D slicer by using VMTK extension. Can anyone please tell me what are the mathematical definitions used over here for calculations? 
Thanks!
