<p>Dear Project Week community,</p>
<p>As mentioned today in the preparation meeting, we will be using <strong>Discord</strong> again before and during PW39 to help coordinate team work and meetings, especially for online participants. If you have not yet familiarized yourself with the Project Week Discord server yet, please do so as soon as possible. The Discord server is ready to be used and you can already use it to plan your team work. You can look at <a href="https://projectweek.na-mic.org/common/Discord.html">this page</a> to find out more on how to use Discord to improve your Project Week experience (thanks to Rudolf Bumm for creating the page).</p>
<p>We take the opportunity to remind you to please register as soon as possible. If you plan to attend in person, use <a href="https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/na-mic-project-week-39-tickets-593226786287">this page on EventBrite</a> to pay your registration fee. Additionally, all participants (both online and in-person) need to fill the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe9dyTCW8Y-RWHEvBUTUXTpbP8Nd9KvUUFpoItuy9_fYKYRfw/viewform">following form</a> to be included as participants to the workshop. Early registration of in-person participants will help us finalize the contract with the caterer for lunch and coffee breaks while general registration helps us plan workshop activities for a certain ratio of online vs in-person participants.</p>
<p>Finally, we would like to ask that you create your project page as soon as possible if you already have at least a vague idea of what you want to work on. This will help us optimize the matchmaking process during the remaining preparation meetings and is likely to increase collaboration amongst participants. The good news is that our friends Jean-Christophe Robin-Fillion and Sam Horvath from Kitware have setup a simplified project page creation tool that involves nothing more than filling a simple form. For more information, see the <a href="https://projectweek.na-mic.org/PW39_2023_Montreal/Readme.html#projects">Projects section</a> on the PW 39 web page. If you need any help with this process, please let us know.</p>
<p>Looking forward to see you all in the last two preparation meetings!</p>
<p>Best</p>
<p>The PW organizing committee</p>
<p>(Tina Kapur, Simon Drouin, Rafael Palomar, Sam Horvath, Theodore Aptekarev)</p>
