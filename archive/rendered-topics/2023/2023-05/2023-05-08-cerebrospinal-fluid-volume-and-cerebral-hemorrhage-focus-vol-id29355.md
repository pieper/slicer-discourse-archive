<p>I am very grateful for your recent reply, which solved many problems for me, and I would like to thank you from the bottom of my heart. I have some questions about MRI again, and I would like to ask you about it. I would like to ask, can 3Dslicer use brain MRI to calculate the volume of cerebrospinal fluid or cerebral infarction foci? I have been researching recently, but I still haven’t found a method, if I can use MRI to calculate, can you please teach me and tell me what the approximate method steps are?</p>

<p>Unfortunately detecting and quantifying cerebral infractions from MRI a complex topic and I can’t describe a step by step solution here.  A lot depends on the quality and the type of the MRI in terms of how well different tissues are imaged.  I know you have already been trying to look for a solution, but probably best would be to study the underlying publications around hemorrhagic stroke imaging so you have a better idea what can and cannot be reliably imaged.  It’s an active research topic so I’m sure you will find many useful papers on the topic.</p>
