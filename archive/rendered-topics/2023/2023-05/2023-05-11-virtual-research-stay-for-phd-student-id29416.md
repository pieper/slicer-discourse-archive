<p>Hello slicers,</p>
<p>My name is Mario Mata form Juarez, Mexico and I am a PhD student in electrical and computer engineering. I am currently working on brain aneurysm detection in MRA and CTA.</p>
<p>I am looking for a virtual collaboration with a researcher from another country to explore new methods and publish a paper.</p>
<p>If any researcher is interested, please do not hesitate to contact me.</p>
