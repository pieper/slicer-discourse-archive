Hi everyone<br>
I have an EPID image and I want to extract the profile curve in this image. can you guide me about this problem?<br>
(A profile curve shows the changes of a parameter such as pixel values across the field.)</p>
<p>thanks a lot</p>

<p>You can use “Line Profile” module (provided by Sandbox extension).</p>
