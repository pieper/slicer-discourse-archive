<p>Operating system:Windows 11<br>
Slicer version:3D slicer 5.2.2<br>
Expected behavior:I want to export the seg.nrrd file together with the original nrrd file as a dicom file<br>
Actual behavior:Now package and export together, and then open the new dicom again without segmentation</p>

<p>Please try with latest Slicer Preview Release and <a href="https://slicer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/modules/segmentations.html#dicom-export">follow these instructions</a>. If you get stuck then let us know.</p>

<p>When I download the relevant extension, I try to export the seg.nrrd and .nrrd files as dicom, but I am prompted that the seg.nrrd file cannot find the referenced volume, how can I fix this?</p>
