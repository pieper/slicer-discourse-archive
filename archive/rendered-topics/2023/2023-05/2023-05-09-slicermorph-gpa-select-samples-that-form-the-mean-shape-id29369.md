<p><strong>Hi,</strong></p>
<p>currently I am analysing several skulls; the plan is to use a subgroup of these<br>
skulls for generating the “mean shape” and then to compute the GP-distance of all<br>
skulls based on this selected “mean shape”.</p>
<p>Is there a way to accomplish this?<br>
There is a way to exclude landmarks in the GPA module; I haven´t found an option<br>
to select the samples which should be used for “mean shape” computation.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
<p>Best,<br>
Markus</p>
