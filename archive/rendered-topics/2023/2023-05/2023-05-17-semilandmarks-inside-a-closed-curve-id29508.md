<p>Hello,<br>
I’m trying to generate a series of surface semilandmarks inside a closed curve on a 3d model. Is there a way to do this? I’ve tried several methods to generate similar results like generating semilandmark patches using the tools provided by SlicerMorph and then trying to use ALPACA to do the same in the sample, but the results are not what I need. The main goal is to have the same number of semilandmarks along the sample in this region that can be delimited easily by a curve. I’m right now using the heart module to create Baffles and its giving me hope but at the same time I wonder if there is a simpler solution.</p>
