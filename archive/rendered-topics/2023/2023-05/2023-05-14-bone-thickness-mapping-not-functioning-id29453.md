<p>Operating system: Windows 10<br>
Slicer version: 5.2.2<br>
Expected behavior: Bone thickness map Extension complete execute<br>
Actual behavior: did not execute</p>
<p>I used the bone thickness map extension on my mesh in 3Dslicer version 5.2.2. When I click execute button, it did not start executing and my mesh missing from the panel box.</p>
<p>Previously with the same step on the same mesh using 3D slicer version 4.1.1, it did execute successfully. Why it cannot be done on latest version 5.2.2 and 5.2.1?</p>
<p>I dont really want to use version 4.1.1 because the crop box is thin and  difficult to use.</p>

<p>With this fix it should work in 3D slicer version 5.10. <a href="https://discourse.slicer.org/t/color-scalar-bar-reworked-and-upgraded-now-it-s-called-color-legend/21567/12" class="inline-onebox">"Color Scalar Bar" reworked and upgraded, now it’s called "Color Legend" - #12 by Mik</a> .</p>
