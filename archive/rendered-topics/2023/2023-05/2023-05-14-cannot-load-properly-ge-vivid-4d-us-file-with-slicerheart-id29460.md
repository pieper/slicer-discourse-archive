<p>Dear Mr Lasso,<br>
I export from Echopac a 4D clip of an heart US.<br>
When I load it in slicer with SlicerHeart extension, I have a warning " Reference image in series does not contain geometry information. Please use caution." When I load anyway , I obtain a clip in the red window and athin line in the 2 others. Is it a problem with the export format or with Slicer ?<br>
Thank you</p>
