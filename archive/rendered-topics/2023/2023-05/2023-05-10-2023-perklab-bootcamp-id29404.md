<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I’m wondering if there’s a Perklab bootcamp being run this year - I see that <a href="https://github.com/PerkLab/PerkLabBootcamp" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">last year’s</a> was offered in a hybrid format and I’m interested in an opportunity for community members to attend online if there’s one coming up!</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Most of our students happened to start in various partner labs, so we did not end up organizing a bootcamp for them this year. To catch up with the Slicer community I would recommend to come to the Slicer project week. You can join remotely, but of course it is much better if you can come in person (it is quite close to you, in Montreal).</p>
