<p>Dear all,<br>
after tractography I used my vtk files to extract measurements using Slicer. In the resulting table there are two columns with numbers that I cannot really identify. They are called “spherical” and “linear”. Is this synonymous for radial and axial diffusivity or something else?<br>
I would really appreciate your help and thank you in advance.<br>
Best wishes<br>
Marlene</p>

<p>Those measures are described in this paper: <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1361841502000531" class="inline-onebox">Processing and visualization for diffusion tensor MRI - ScienceDirect</a></p>
