<p>See the list of available metrics <a href="https://slicer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/modules/segmentstatistics.html#computed-metrics">here</a>. If you are interested in quantifying bones then also check out the <a href="https://github.com/jmhuie/Slicer-SegmentGeometry#segmentgeometry">SegmentGeometry extension</a>.</p>
