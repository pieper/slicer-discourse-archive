<p>recently almost all interface functions open in another window whenever slicer is in full-screen view.</p>
<p>I’m using 5.3  on Mac OS Venture Version 13.3.1  with Apple M2 Pro</p>

<p>Probably popups appear in the application’s screen.</p>
<p>Do you move the application to a different screen after you start it?</p>
<p>Does it help if you delete Slicer.ini settings file? (in the <a href="http://slicer.org">slicer.org</a> subfolder in your user profile folder)</p>
