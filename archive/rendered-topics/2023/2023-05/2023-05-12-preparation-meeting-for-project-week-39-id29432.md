<p>Project Week#39 will be held June 12-16, 2023, at École de Technologie Supérieur (ETS) in Montreal, Canada. The meeting will have a hybrid format to make it possible to participate remotely. Please look here for additional details: <a href="https://projectweek.na-mic.org/PW39_2023_Montreal/">https://projectweek.na-mic.org/PW39_2023_Montreal/</a></p>
<p><em>Preparation</em> : To prepare, we will be holding weekly meetings at 10am on Tuesdays, starting <strong>May</strong> <strong>2nd, 2023</strong> and ending on June 6th.</p>
<p><em>Background</em> : The Project Week is a week-long hackathon of hands on activity in which medical image computing researchers create solutions using the open source image computing platform, 3D Slicer, and VTK, ITK, CMake, and CDash libraries as well as OHIF, Cornerstone, dcmjs, vtkjs, itkjs, DICOMweb, Girder and related web technologies. Participants work collaboratively on solutions that lie at the interfaces of the fields of computer science, mechanical engineering, biomedical engineering, and medicine. In contrast to conferences and workshops where the primary focus is to report results, the objective of the ProjectWeek is to provide a venue for creators of medical image computing open-source software creators to collaboratively work.</p>
