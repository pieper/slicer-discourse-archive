<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
<p>We gladly announce the workshop for Shape in Medical Imaging (SHAPEMI, <a href="https://shapemi.github.io/">https://shapemi.github.io/</a>) to be held in conjunction with the conference on MICCAI – Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Interventions, in Vancouver, Canada, Oct. 8th, 2023. ShapeMI will be happening in a hybrid form this year, with an in person program in the morning and a virtual program in the afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>Aim and Scope</strong></p>
<p>Shape and geometry processing methods are receiving increased attention, notably, in medical imaging.This workshop provide a presentation venue for researchers working in shape and geometrical analysis, such as shape modeling, geometric learning and statistics. This year’s edition also brings a focus on applications. Original contributions as well as well as exciting applications in medical imaging involving shapes are sought in the form of:</p>
<ul>
<li>12-15 page full papers</li>
<li>6-11 page short papers</li>
</ul>
<p>in LNCS style. Accepted papers will be presented at ShapeMI 2023 in the form of posters (during the virtual portion of the workshop) or oral presentations. Every accepted paper can include a live demo.</p>
<p><strong>Targets topics include, but are not limited to:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Shape Processing and Analysis</li>
<li>Shape Learning and Classification</li>
<li>Geometric Learning and Manifold-based Methods</li>
<li>Statistics of Shapes and Deformations</li>
<li>Spectral Shape Analysis</li>
<li>Spectral Clustering and Dimensionality Reduction</li>
<li>Shape Modeling and Representation</li>
<li>Shape Segmentation, Registration and Correspondence</li>
<li>Geometry-constrained Deep Learning and Optimization</li>
<li>Statistical Shape Modeling</li>
<li>Synthetic Anatomical Shape Generation</li>
<li>Generative Shape Models</li>
<li>Longitudinal Shape Analysis and Processing</li>
<li>Medical Applications focused on Shape Analysis</li>
<li>Evaluation / quality assessment of shape models</li>
<li>Relevant demos of freely available shape analysis software</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>This years’ keynote speakers include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Prof. Miaomiao Zhang, University of Virginia</li>
<li>Prof. Steve Pizer, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill</li>
</ul>
<p>This workshop will provide an invaluable opportunity for researchers to present recent work on shape analysis in medical imaging. Interactions among fellow researchers will foster a deeper understanding of the underlying concepts and will provide insights on medical imaging applications.</p>
<p>Best Paper Award Sponsored by TBD.</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT DATES (Tentative)</strong></p>
<p>Deadline for paper submission: ** June 30th, 2023, 23:59 PST **<br>
Notification of Acceptance: July, 2023<br>
MICCAI Early bird registration: August, 2023<br>
SHAPEMI Workshop on: Oct. 8th, 2023</p>
