<p>Hello</p>
<p>Currently, I am trying to segment the adipose tissue from MR Images. Now I am using the radiology app from MONAILabel. I am manually segment the data using Slicer (see attached).</p>
<p>I do not need to accurately segment the data but just to be sure to include voxels which include fat and not muscle other components of the image.</p>
<p>Do you know a faster way to segment the fat, rather than segmenting manually and using the radiology app?</p>
<p>Best,<br>
Spiros.<br>
