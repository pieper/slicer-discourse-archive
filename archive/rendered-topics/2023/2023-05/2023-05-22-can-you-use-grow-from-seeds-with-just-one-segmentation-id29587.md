<p>I’m new to Slicer and I’m trying to use the grow from seeds function. Can I use it for just the aorta, or do I have to be making multiple segmentations?</p>

<p>You always need at least two segments for grow from seeds.  You can just make everything that is not aorta into a catchall background class.</p>
