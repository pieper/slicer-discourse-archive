<p>For a while we experimented with replacing the Slicer main window with our own widget, but later we figured it is much better for many reasons to customize the main window instead (hide what we don’t need, add any custom widgets, toolbars, menus, etc. that we need).</p>
<p>See <a href="https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/Nightly/Developers/Slicelets">this page</a> for more information and examples.</p>
