<p>I would be grateful if anyone could help with the binWidth choice. Even after the default normalization in SlicerRadiomics (normalize: true), I observe that the intensity ranges vary among different MRIs up to over five-fold.<br>
My precise questions are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is then the binWidth set subjectively to fall anywhere within a recommended 16-130 range for all images?</li>
<li>Is it advisable to use Freedman–Diaconis rule or just the 16-130 binWidth number guesstimate?<br>
Many thanks in advance, Marko</li>
</ul>
