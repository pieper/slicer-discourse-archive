<p>I understand that the scale factor has not been functioning properly for some time, and in order to obtain high-resolution screenshots, it appears that offscreen rendering is currently the only option. Is it possible to add offscreen rendering as a feature to replace scale factor?</p>

<p>Yes, it would be possible but it would require some effort.  People who want to see this happen sooner should vote for this feature request.  See <a href="https://discourse.slicer.org/t/higher-resolution-for-screen-captures-of-3d-view/8880/30">this post</a> for the current workaround.</p>

<p>For posterity, this is now available as the HiResScreenCapture module of SlicerMorph extension. It does require the 5.7 preview as the minimum version.</p>
