<p>Dear All,<br>
I hope you are doing well.</p>
<p>I am a PhD student working on segmenting oct images. In the first phase of my work, I am investigating tools to annotate our data. I have recently used the Slicer, and I would be grateful if you could ask my questions about utilizing it for my work:</p>
<ol>
<li>Good annotation objects to annotate curves and layers of the retina. To be exact, creating thin (narrow) lines on the layers (or curves). I have tried some objects, such as thresholding, painter, draw tube , …, but none of them is exactly what I need  2) Carrying the annotations over other B-Scans to avoid repeating doctors’ annotation and allowing them to edit the result.<br>
Thanks a lot.<br>
Best,<br>
Ali</li>
</ol>
