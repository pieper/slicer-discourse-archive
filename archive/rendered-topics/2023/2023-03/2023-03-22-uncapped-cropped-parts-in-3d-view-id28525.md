<p>Hello Slicer community,</p>
<p>I don’t know if there is a workaround for this or not, but I wanted to see if there is a way to “cap” the cropped parts along the cropping plane?</p>
<p></p><div class="video-container">
    <video width="100%" height="100%" preload="metadata" controls="">
      <source src="https://us1.discourse-cdn.com/flex002/uploads/slicer/original/3X/c/4/c4fa0ea18337f2f0d0a1c97e1b199a6b381cfe37.mp4">

    </source></video>
  </div><p></p>
<p>As you can see in the video, it makes understanding the intracardiac anatomy a bit challenging when other overlapping parts can be seen through the cropped part.</p>
<p>Regards,<br>
