<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am currently building an application in VR that should allow drawing on a 3D surface (e.g. Skull model). I have used the "Draw on a Surface Feature’ in Slicer. I would like to know how it is precisely done. If you could share any references that would be very helpful.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

I might have not been able to explain what I meant exactly in my post. Here I attached a video. I just wanted to know how the erase or similar kind of functions get activated when the cursor is on the model and how to define such parameters.<p></p>
<p>Thanks</p>
