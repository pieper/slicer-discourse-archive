<p>Hi All, i currently working with the newest version of Slicer 5.30 and i have problem with the interactive lobe segmentation where it can’t divide right lung lobes.<br>
I already put several dots on the right fissures but it only appeared 2 segmentation.<br>
Is there any solution to this problem?</p>
