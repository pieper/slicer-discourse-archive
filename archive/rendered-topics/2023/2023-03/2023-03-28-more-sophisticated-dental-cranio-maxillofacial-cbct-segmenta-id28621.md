<p>Hi dear,</p>
<p>Do we (3D Slicer) have more advanced segmentation for mandibula or maxilla extraction from CBCT scan? they are namely;</p>
<ul>
<li>Snakes or active contours</li>
<li>Live wire segmentation</li>
<li>Statistical shape models</li>
<li>Level set segmentation</li>
</ul>
<p>“My aim is to learn &amp; teach more advanced methods.”</p>

<p>These are all classic methods that have proven to work poorly compared to current deep learning based segmentation methods. I would recommend to join discussions on the forum on using AI for dental/cranio-maxillofacial segmentations - describe who you are and what you would like to achieve. See for example this discussion that was started a few days ago:</p>

    Dear 3D Slicer Community, 
I am writing to you with great admiration and respect for your hard work in creating such an amazing platform. I am a second-year orthodontic resident from Hungary with a strong interest in 3D planning. 
As a part of my work, I spend a lot of time manually segmenting our CBCTs. Recently, I had the opportunity to try the trial version of Diagnocat’s AI segmentator system, and I was impressed with its efficiency. This experience has sparked my curiosity about AI-driven s…
