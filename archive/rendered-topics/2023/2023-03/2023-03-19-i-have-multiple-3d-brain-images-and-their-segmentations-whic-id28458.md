<p>Hi, community,</p>
<p>I am new to radiomics and currently working on my research in MRI brain scans. I have successfully created the features but wanted to discuss with someone experienced for 15-20’ about the most defining characteristics and general wisdom from his/her experience.</p>
<p>I would very much appreciate it,</p>
<p>Andreas</p>
