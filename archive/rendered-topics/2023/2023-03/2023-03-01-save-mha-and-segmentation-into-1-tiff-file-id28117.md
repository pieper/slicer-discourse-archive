<p>Can I somehow merge my scan with the segmentation I did into one tiff file?<br>
With the save option, I’m only able to save the files separately</p>

<p>You mean you want to display the segmentation maps overlaid to your scan, but saved as sequences of TIFFs?</p>
<p>You might be able to do that with the screencapture module, check this thread for pointers. <a href="https://discourse.slicer.org/t/exporting-jpgs-of-mri-slices/28057/2" class="inline-onebox">Exporting jpgs of MRI slices - #2 by pieper</a></p>
