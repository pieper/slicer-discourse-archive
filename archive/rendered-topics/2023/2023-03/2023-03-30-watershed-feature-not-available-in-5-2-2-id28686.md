<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I just downloaded the updated slicer version 5.2.2 and I don’t see the watershed function, as well as some other functions, in the segment editor module. Is this a bug or were they taken out for some reason?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Watershed and many more Segment Editor effects are provided by SegmentEditorExtraEffects extension. To make it easier to bring over extensions from previous Slicer versions, you can <a href="https://discourse.slicer.org/t/new-feature-automatic-update-of-extensions/24416">bookmark them and reinstall all by a single click</a>.</p>
