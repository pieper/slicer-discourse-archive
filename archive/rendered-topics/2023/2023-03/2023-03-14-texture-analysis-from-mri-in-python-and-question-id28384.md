<p>Dear Slicer community,</p>
<p>Apologies if this is the wrong category. Long time slicer user!</p>
<p>I’m interested in texture analysis from a DICOM file. Is there a slicer add on that would do this? Also I’ve looked at papers to try to find example output, would you be able to infer the stiffness of say an organ or tumor? I know there is paid software available but wondered if there were add ons or python code to do this.</p>
<p>Kind Regards and many thanks in advance.</p>
<p>Peter</p>

<p>You may want to check out <a href="https://www.radiomics.io/">SlicerRadiomics</a>.  It’s been cited a lot so you should be able to get a good idea how well it’s worked for cases like you have in mind.</p>

<p>Many thanks it is a very niche application I’m looking to apply it for, I’ll have a look.</p>
