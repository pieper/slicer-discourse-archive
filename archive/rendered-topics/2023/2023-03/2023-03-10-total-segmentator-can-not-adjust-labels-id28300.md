<p>I use totalSegmentator to get the label of ROI.<br>
I want to adjust the label. But, the buttons on Segment Editor seem unfunctional.<br>
I want to shrink 3.0mm from edge of the label.<br>
It will be appreciate if someone can teach me how to operate it.</p>

<p>TotalSegmentator extension in 3D Slicer creates a segmentation that can be edited in Segment Editor module if you select the segmentation and a source volume.</p>

<p>I successfully adjust the segmentation by selecting the volume.<br>
Thank you for your reply!</p>
