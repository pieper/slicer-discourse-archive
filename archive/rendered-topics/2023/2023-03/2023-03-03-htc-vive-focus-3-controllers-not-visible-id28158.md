<p>Operating system: Windows 10<br>
Slicer version: 4.11.20210226<br>
Expected behavior: Controllers visible during VR session<br>
Actual behavior: Controllers not visible, but the ability to interact with the volume is present.</p>
<p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>I initially tried to use SlicerVirtualReality with Slicer 5.2.2 and eventually managed to see my segmentation, but the image was strobing and visible only to one eye. I also had the issue with “the action manifest for slicerapp-real was not found” message, but downloading needed .json files, as suggested in another post, helped. Going back to Slicer 4.11.20210226 fixed the issue with the image.<br>
However, neither in 5.2.2 nor in 4.11.20210226 I was able to see my controllers, even though in 4.11.20210226 I was able to interact with the scene as wall as fly around using the thumbstick. Switching the “Controller visible” option on and off did not help unfortunately.<br>
My headset is HTC Vive Focus 3 with its original controllers.</p>
<p>Many thanks for any help in this regard!</p>
