<p>Hi all!</p>
<p>I just downloaded this very helpful application today and have been learning how to make a 3d model of a skull.</p>
<p>When I see it in the viewer, it has a nice, gunmetal grey kind of color, but when I segment it and make an stl file from it, it opens up almost white.</p>
<p>Does anyone know of a way I can keep it that nice grey color?</p>
<p>Thank so much for any help! I’ve been searching for an answer but either the answers I am finding are a bit too complicated for me as my first - day level, or they are not relevant.</p>
<p>Thanks again! <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/smiley.png?v=12" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>

<p>STL files don’t store color.  What are you using to look at the file?</p>

<p>Ooooh. I did not realize that, thank you! I was using Preview.<br>
Hmm. I’ll look into seeing if there’s a way to import into Blender and then give it a material, maybe.</p>
<p>Thanks again!</p>

<p>Yes, Blender is great for this sort of thing.  Depending on how you want to use the file glTF might be a good format to use.</p>
