<p>Dear all,</p>
<p>I can not find the following feature:</p>
<p>I am working with MRI images and need to mark pathologies with ROI (I like using “Closed Curve”). While I can select in “Measurements” to show the “Area”, it does not provide e.g. mean intensities. That’s very sad. Using “Segments” is a bit too time consuming for clinical routine or during supervision. And yes, I already use segments <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/wink.png?v=12" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>
<p>Would be nice to have such a feature or maybe py workaround.</p>
<p>Thank you all for this great software!</p>
