<p>Hi,<br>
Im a med student and pretty new about 3D Slicer.<br>
I want to calculate lung vessel BV5/TBV and PA:A.<br>
Recently i have been read this journal, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7173739/" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Radiographic Pulmonary Vessel Volume, Lung Function, and Airways Disease in the Framingham Heart Study - PMC</a> as a reference, but i still don’t know how to do it.</p>
<p>Can you help me explain step by step how to generate 3d model of lung vessel using CIP module, then calculate BV5/TBV and PA:A?</p>
<p>Many thanks.</p>
