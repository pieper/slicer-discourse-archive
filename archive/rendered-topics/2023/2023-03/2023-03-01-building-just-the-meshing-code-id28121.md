<p>I’m interested in using the VMTK meshing code for my own CFD project. Is there any build procedure for building only the meshing code, and perhaps limiting the required dependencies to just the ones needed by the meshing code (if any). Note that I’m interested in using VMTK without tetgen, without gmsh, and without any other external meshing code.</p>
<p>By the way, does the volumetric mesher generate tetrahedral meshes only, or is it also able to generate hexahedral meshes?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
