<p>Operating system: Windows<br>
Slicer version: 5.2.1</p>
<p>I am using slicer and I have extracted the centerline network for an arterial model. Is it possible to automatically perform cross-sectional analysis for each of the centerlines and save these in a tsv, as would happen if you did it manually?</p>

<p>As for the above, I guess you have SlicerVMTK extension already installed, since you are using Slicer and you have extracted the centerline network. You should therefore be able to use ‘Cross-section analysis’ module with your centerlines.</p>
<p>As for ‘automatically’ and ‘save these in a tsv’, it’s hard to understand what you mean.</p>
<p>Lastly, consider using stable 5.2.2, or better, Slicer preview.</p>
