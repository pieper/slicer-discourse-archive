<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I would like to change the color of the tables  in a Custom App based on SlicerCAT.<br>
I managed to change the color of the App with the palette in the QAppStyle.cxx file.</p>
<p>However, I still have a brown color for one line out of two in the tables that I am unable to change<br>

<p>Does anyone have an idea how to control this color?<br>
Thanks !</p>
