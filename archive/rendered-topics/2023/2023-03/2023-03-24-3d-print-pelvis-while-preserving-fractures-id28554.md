<p>Hi</p>
<p>I am working on one of the projects in which I have 3D scan of a fractured pelvis. I intend to process the model in a way to preserve actual fractures, while at the the same ensuring the smoothing of the rest of the model.</p>
<p>Is it even possible through 3D-Slicer? If yes which tools would I require to achieve the desired task.</p>

<p>Yes, this is exactly what <a href="https://github.com/sebastianandress/Slicer-SurfaceWrapSolidify#surface-wrap-solidify">SurfaceWrapSolidify extension</a> is developed for.</p>
