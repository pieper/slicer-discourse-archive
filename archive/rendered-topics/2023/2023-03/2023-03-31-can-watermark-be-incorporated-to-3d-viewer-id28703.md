<p>Currently, I am using the ScreenCapture module to include a watermark in 3D rendering. However, when I do four up screenshots (with a screen snapshot tool), that watermark is not visible. Is it possible to have the watermark displayed inside the 3D viewer as well.</p>
<p>Also, I noticed that if the “transparent” option is chosen, watermark is not stamped to the image.</p>

<p>Quick follow up. I noticed that I can indeed choose to include the other views in the ScreenCapture using the “all views” option. That solves my issue, however, I still think it is a good thing to have the option of  including a watermark in the 3D renderer.</p>
