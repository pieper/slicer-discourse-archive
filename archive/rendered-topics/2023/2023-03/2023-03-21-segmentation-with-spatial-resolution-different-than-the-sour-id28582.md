<p>Hello all</p>
<p>This conversation was an inspiration of the following issue I am facing now with segments:)</p>
<p>I have done so far an air segmentation with spatial resolution different than the master volume . Air segmentation was in resolution of (0.33X 0.33) in 2D and the master volume (MRI) is (1.96X1.96). Attached is an example<br>

<p>Looking forward for an answer:)</p>
<p>For other issues I have to downsampl the air segments into the master volume resolution. Is that possible</p>
