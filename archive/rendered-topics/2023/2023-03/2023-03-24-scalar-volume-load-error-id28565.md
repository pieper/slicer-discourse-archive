<p>I am trying to upload DICOM files to slicer to convert them to an NRRD and STL. I am able to import the files into the DICOM Database but receive an error “Could not load: 3036: Linear Attenuation [1-cm] (3036) as a Scalar Volume” when I try to load the data. My study is named "Linear Attenuation [1/cm] on</p>

<p>I followed the instructions and am still getting the “Could not load as a Scalar Volume” error. I have also tried the patcher add-on and still not able to load the data. I only have .DCM files and no not have access to the original scan data</p>
