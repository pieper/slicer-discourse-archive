<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I’m currently trying to image intervertebral discs in the ultrasound machine. I have acquired a video as either DICOM or mp4 file by rotating the probe around the disc and obtaining a 360 representation.<br>
However, I have been trying to generate a volume on 3D Slicer, but I have observed that it only stacks the images in the Z plane. I wanted to know if it was possible to insert a series of images with a specified transform, like 2º in the PA plane, to generate a volume.</p>
