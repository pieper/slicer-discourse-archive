<p>I was wondering if you have the paper or more info about it, I believe this algorithm works as a seeded region growing algorithm right? I would like to cite it and also know more detailed how it works. Thanks!</p>

<p>See references <a href="https://github.com/InsightSoftwareConsortium/ITKGrowCut">here</a>. A new paper about that describes the final implementation of the algorithm is under review.</p>
