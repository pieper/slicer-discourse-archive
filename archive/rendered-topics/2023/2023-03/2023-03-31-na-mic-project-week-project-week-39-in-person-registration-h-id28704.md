<p>Dear Project Week community,</p>
<p>We can’t wait to welcome you in Montreal for the 39th edition next June (12-16). The registration page for in-person attendees is already up. It can be reached from the main <a href="https://projectweek.na-mic.org/PW39_2023_Montreal/">PW 39 webpage</a> or using <a href="https://www.eventbrite.ca/e/na-mic-project-week-39-tickets-593226786287">this link</a>.</p>
<p><strong>One important piece of information</strong> : If you plan to attend PW 39 in person, we recommend making hotel reservations as soon as possible. The workshop falls on the week before the F1 racing weekend in Montreal (June 16-18) and hotels are filling rapidly as we approach the event. We will not reserve blocks of rooms at a specific hotel for this edition of Project Week, but there are plenty of options around the ETS campus where PW takes place, especially in the nearby historic district of Montreal. Project Week will run from Monday through Friday as always, but as we expect hotel reservations to be more complicated for Friday, we have decided to hold the project result presentations on Thursday this time.</p>
<p>We can’t wait to meet again with you all for the first preparation meeting on June 2nd! Stay tuned!</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>
<p>The PW organizing committee</p>
<p>(Tina Kapur, Simon Drouin, Rafael Palomar, Sam Horvath, Theodore Aptekarev)</p>
