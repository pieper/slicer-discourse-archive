<p>Operating system:Windows 10pro<br>
Slicer version: Slicer 5.2.1</p>
<p>Hello all</p>
<p>I have made some air segmentation of 25 slice dataset. I was wondering if there is an easy way to calculate the volume of the segments.</p>
<p>Happy to provide more info if needed and looking forward for answers.</p>
<p>Best<br>

<p>You can use segment statistics module for that.</p>

<p>Hi there- I had this same question. I have opened the extension manager but cannot find an extension called “segment statistics”. Can I please check if I have the name right?<br>
Thanks<br>

<p>Please disregard! I’m so sorry!<br>
I dug around in the modules menus and have found it.</p>
