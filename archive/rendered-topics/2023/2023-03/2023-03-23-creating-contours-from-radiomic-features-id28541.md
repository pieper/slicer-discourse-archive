<p>I want to contour the lung according to the Radiomics feature results.<br>
Is there a tool for me to do this? Or will I have to use Pyradiomics?<br>
Thanks.</p>

<p>Have you created “feature image” (an image which has its voxels corresponding to some feature)? If yes, then you can go to the Segment Editor module and use this feature image as source volume.</p>
