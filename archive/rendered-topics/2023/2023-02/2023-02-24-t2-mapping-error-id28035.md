<p>Dear Slicer community,</p>
<p>I have been using T2 mapping extension for phantom data acquired on a preclinical Bruker 7T PET-MR (MGE sequence with 30 echo times) but it didn’t work. The problem is I have a multi-slice image and each slice correspond to a value of TE. So, i can’t enter the image in input volume.</p>
<p>My question is: how can I modify the code to work in my data?</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for your reply.</p>
