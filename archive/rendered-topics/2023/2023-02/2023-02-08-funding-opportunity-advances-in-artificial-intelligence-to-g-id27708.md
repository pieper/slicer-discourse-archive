<p>Do you have expertise using AI tools for automated annotation of cancer imaging data?</p>
<p><strong>Put those to work annotating data in <a href="https://portal.imaging.datacommons.cancer.gov/">NCI Imaging Data Commons</a> and get funding to do this!</strong></p>
<p>See the details at the funding opportunity announcement here: <a href="https://sam.gov/opp/c8e97bbc54944eda92645e1629df8228/view">https://sam.gov/opp/c8e97bbc54944eda92645e1629df8228/view</a>.</p>
<p>Quoting the RFP:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The goal of the AI in Medical Imaging (AIMI) initiative is to solicit proposals for curation of derived datasets in the form of advanced machine-generated segmentation of tumor and organ contents of radiology collections, hereafter referred to as AIMI Annotations in the NCI Imaging Data Commons.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Beware of the short timeline for applying (quoted from the RFP page):</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Vendors Request for Proposal – Up to February 13, 2023; RFP will be distributed upon request</li>
<li>Questions Due; February 21 ,2023 at 3:00 PM</li>
<li>Proposals Due by March 10, 2023, at 3:00 PM</li>

<p>Hi Andrey,<br>
This is very interesting, thanks for sharing.<br>
Do you think we can get the advantage of it even by using a Monai app?<br>
The concept is a little bit vague for me.<br>
Best,<br>

<p>To all those asking questions, please note that I am not representing the entity soliciting applications in response to that RFP. The purpose of my post was to simply raise awareness of this RFP. I believe the RFP page has the information about contact email to reach out with any questions.</p>
