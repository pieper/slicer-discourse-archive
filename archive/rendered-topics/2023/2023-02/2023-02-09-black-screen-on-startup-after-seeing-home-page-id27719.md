<p>I have 5.3.0 running on an old desktop but not on a somewhat newer laptop. are there debug levels I can set to see exactly what the problem is?</p>
<p>Thank you!<br>

<p>Please, give more information about your setup. Which operating system are you using? Did you build Slicer yourself or did you downloaded the pre-built binaries? If you downloaded the binaries, maybe you would like to give a try to 5.2.1 (stable) instead of preview version just to see if that makes a difference.</p>

<p>Hello,<br>
I am running Win 10 Pro and a pre-built binary. I tried 5.2.1 and got the same results (also, similiar to others, there does appear to be a home screen behind it, with right clicking giving different options, etc.<br>
I can run 5.3 on my older home machine and I am trying a “last-ditch” effort to run 5.3 under a dual boot Linux environment on my laptop. I realize the hardware is old (by laptop standards <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/grinning.png?v=12" title=":grinning:" class="emoji" alt=":grinning:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20">)<br>
Thank you!<br>
Gene</p>

<p>I installed Ubuntu on the laptop and am running the Linux version of 5.3.0 without any problems.</p>
