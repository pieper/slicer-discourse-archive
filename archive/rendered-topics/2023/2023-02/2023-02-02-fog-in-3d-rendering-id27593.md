<p>In ancient versions of 3D Slicer there was a fog tab to add to a 3D scene. It had the merit of making more visible some structures by hiding in a progressive way the background. Was great for interactive presentations. Using the newer versions I don’t find it anymore. Is it hidden somewhere?</p>

<p>I remember we used to have it, but I believe the method we used became incompatible with newer vtk versions and we needed to drop it.  I haven’t seen that feature in a while so it may be some work to bring it back.</p>

<p>Thanks Steve. I liked it very much as a display feature. Maybe someone is interested in working on that again.</p>
