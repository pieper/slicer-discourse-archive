<p><code>vtkSurfaceNets3D</code>, a new <a href="https://discourse.vtk.org/t/new-isocontouring-filter-for-discrete-labled-volumetric-data-vtksurfacenets3d/10614" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">iso-contouring filter</a>, is available in VTK. Will said it is planned to be used in Slicer. It sounds like it should significantly speed up label map to surface conversion, as it can also do smoothing during conversion. Is there any expectation when it will land in Slicer?</p>

<p>I don’t think we have a set plan, but people are very excited about Sarah’s technique and Will’s implementation so I think it will happen soon.</p>
