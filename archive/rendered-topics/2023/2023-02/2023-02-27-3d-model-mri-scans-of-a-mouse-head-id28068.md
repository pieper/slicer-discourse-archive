<p>Dear all!</p>
<p>It is a far fetched question but any help is appreciated! I am an architect from Sweden that is quite interested in 3D modelling and lately i have been interested in 3D Slicer. I Just want to see and explore models of animals as well. I had the idea to make a 3D Model of nasal cavity of a mouse from MRI but i can not find any scans nor a 3D model to compare. Do any of you maybe have a 3D Model of the head of a mouse? Or any tips of where to find MRI Scans at least?</p>
<p>Thank you all for your help in advance.</p>

<p>There are several publicly available mouse atlases (high-resolution scans + segmentation). For example, check this out: <a href="http://www.via.cornell.edu/microdb.html" class="inline-onebox">Public Micro CT Murin Image Database</a></p>
