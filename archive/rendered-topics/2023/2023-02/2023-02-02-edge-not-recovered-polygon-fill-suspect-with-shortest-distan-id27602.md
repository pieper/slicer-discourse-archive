<p>I am getting the following error when marking up on a surface/model:</p>
<p>[VTK] vtkDelaunay2D (0000024030965F60): Edge not recovered, polygon fill suspect</p>
<p>[VTK] - Warning: Warning: In D:\D\P\S-0-build\VTK\Filters\Core\vtkDelaunay2D.cxx, line 1409</p>
<p>It is very reproducible with my own hi-res CT data, but I would not reproduce it with the sample CT data (head and heart).  No problem with spline measurements.</p>
<p>Any idea what the error message mean or how to troubleshoot?</p>
