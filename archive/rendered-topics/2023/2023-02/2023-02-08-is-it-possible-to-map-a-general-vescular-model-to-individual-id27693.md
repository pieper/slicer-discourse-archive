<p>In some clinical applications, some doctors ask me if there is a way to register blood vessels to the actual patient’s head through AR. I don’t know how to do it. Can someone help me with some suggestions?</p>

<p>Yes, this is perfectly doable. If accuracy requirement is about 5-10mm then visual alignment based on skin surface is usually sufficient.</p>
<p>Javier Pascau’s group has recently created a general-purpose AI viewer app for HoloLens2, which may be usable for this. See some more details here (from the Slicer Project Week a few weeks ago): <a href="https://projectweek.na-mic.org/PW38_2023_GranCanaria/Projects/ARinSlicer/" class="inline-onebox">NA-MIC Project Weeks | Website for NA-MIC Project Weeks</a></p>
