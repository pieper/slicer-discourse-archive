<p>Operating system: Ubuntu 22.04<br>
Slicer version:  5.2.2<br>
Hello All.<br>
I have an MRI scan that I need to segment into N homogenous compartments for later reconstruction. The challenge here is that it’s not whatever organ, and the rest is background, but it has to be compartments.<br>
Is there a way to do that with slicer?<br>
UPDATE:<br>
Here is a link to the file via google drive: <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zFCewDPTZrOlu_-3JxJOX0wXDwuqYPos/view?usp=share_link" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zFCewDPTZrOlu_-3JxJOX0wXDwuqYPos/view?usp=share_link</a></p>

<p><a class="mention" href="/u/zinoviy_weinstein">@Zinoviy_Weinstein</a> You have shared a single slice. Do you need to do 2D image segmentation? What is the clinical goal?</p>

<p>Yes. This is a 2D 1H anatomical image that needs to be segmented to use in later image reconstruction of “crappier” images.</p>
