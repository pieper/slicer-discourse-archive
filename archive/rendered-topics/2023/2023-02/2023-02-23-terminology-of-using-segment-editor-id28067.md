<p>Hello,</p>
<p>May I get your opinion about the terminology of using segment editor. When we used the segment editor, we filled the color in the area that we want to segment in each slice. In those case, could you pls explain about how to write these step in order to understand the other people (I mean segmented and filled with the color??) Thank you.</p>
