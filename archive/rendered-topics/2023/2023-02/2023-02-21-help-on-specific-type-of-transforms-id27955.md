<p>Hi all, I was wondering if anyone had insights into the problem I am having. I am trying to transform 15 nodes (bones) by passing in a file that has their respective transformation matrix. An example of the .dat file that stores the 15 transformation matrix can be found here: <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1p7kUwzsx4JR1FxGTpEW8VcZY47IruXKv/view?usp=sharing" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">14727_Motion01R.dat - Google Drive</a></p>
<p>We have 10 other .dat files that house their own set of 15 transformation matrices. Together, the files and the matrices housed within them represent a full movement. Ultimately, I would like to be able to insert these 10 files and then be able to visualize the movement in slicer. I have played around with the transforms module, however, I do not believe that this module has the features I am looking for.</p>
<p>Any help would be much appreciated. Thank you in advance.</p>
