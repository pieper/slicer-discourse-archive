<p>Hi all, I am trying to “register” two different MR images (one postcontrast and one non fat saturated) taken in the same acquisition. There is no patient motion, so it should essentially just be a matter of cropping the non fat saturated images, which were taken with a much larger field of view (lungs and spine visible) than the postcontrast images, which are focused on the breasts and which I am treating as the fixed image. I was hoping to simply apply the elastix rigid registration in Slicer, but this doesn;t work (crops off the top of the non fat sat images). Does anyone have a suggestion as to how I should proceed? Any pointers would be much appreciated <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>
