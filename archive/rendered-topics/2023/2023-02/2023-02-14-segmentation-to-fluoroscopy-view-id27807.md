<p>Hello esteemed Slicer community,</p>
<p>I was wondering if there is a way to view the CT volume as DDR, with segmentations overlaid as structures containing contrast? This would be very helpful for procedural planning like PDA or complex pulmonary vein intervention in congenital heart disease space. I think the commercial competitor has something like this under “fluoroscopy view”.</p>
<p>I appreciate everybody’s insight in advance.</p>

<p>We are working exactly on this tool and recently implemented the features you described. We’ll release the module in SlicerHeart extension as soon as our first paper on this gets published. If you want to get early access then you may contact the principal investigator, <a href="https://www.research.chop.edu/people/matthew-a-jolley">Matt Jolley</a>. He is extremely busy, so he might not have time to respond or arrange this early access, but if you introduce yourself and briefly describe to him why this is important for you then he might be able to make it.</p>

<p>Thanks Andras. I was just curious to see if there is a workaround or if it is on developers’ radar. I’ll wait for the official release.</p>
<p>Regards,<br>
