<p>Operating system: windows 10<br>
Slicer version: 4.10.2<br>
Expected behavior: I am new to it, so not sure what to expect<br>
Actual behavior:</p>
<p>I have a set of dcm dose files exported from Muriplan. Originally, those are axial files. I only one dcm file, from the reconstruction, in this case a coronal plane (I know the position of the plane I need). I need to export it in Radiotherapy RTDose format. Is that possible?<br>
Thank you<br>
Ileana</p>
