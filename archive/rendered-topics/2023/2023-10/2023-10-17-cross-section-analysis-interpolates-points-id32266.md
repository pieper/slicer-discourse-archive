<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I’m attempting to automate the process of extracting the vessel area in a cross-sectional view. The plan is to utilize the cross-sectional analysis module. I initially expected that the number of points in the centerline and the table would be the same, but this isn’t the case (in version 5.4.0; it was in version 5.2.2).</p>
<p>How can I extract only the values of the centerline points without the need to locate each point individually in the list?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
