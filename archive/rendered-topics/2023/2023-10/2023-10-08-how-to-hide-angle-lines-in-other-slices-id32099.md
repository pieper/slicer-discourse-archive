<p>I placed lines, curves, and angle lines on the same level at the same time,<br>
but when I moved the plane, both lines and curves disappeared immediately.<br>
Why didn’t the angle lines disappear?<br>
I want the angle line to be shown only at the placement level, and how to make it disappear at other levels as well.<br>

<p>Thanks for reporting this.  I can reproduce this too.  It seems to be an issue with the projection visibility feature.  Maybe <a class="mention" href="/u/sunderlandkyl">@Sunderlandkyl</a> could have a look?</p>
