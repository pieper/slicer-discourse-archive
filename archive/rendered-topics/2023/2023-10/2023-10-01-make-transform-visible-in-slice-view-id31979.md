<p>I’ve created a cylinder model using ‘create models’, and I can see it on the 3d view.<br>
Is there a way of seeing the cylinder in the slice view before creating it into a segment?<br>
Thanks so much</p>

<p>Yes, you can enable 2D visibility in the Data module by right-clicking on the eye icon; or check the Visibility checkbox in Models module / Display / Slice Display section.</p>
