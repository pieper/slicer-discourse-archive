<p>Good afternoon everyone. As a 3dslicer user I want to comment that when downloading the software installer I detected a Trojan “Trojan.Win32.Generic”.<br>
Some time ago I was working with another computer and after approximately a month, it began to suffer a lot of damage, such as a direct attack on the antivirus making it impossible to delete, problems with the sound and, lastly, it did not allow me to open other programs. I want to know if anyone has had this problem, to find a solution since I don’t want to risk installing it on my new computer. Thank you so much</p>

<p>There have been previous reports of false virus alarms.  Pobably the same advice is still true.</p>
