<p>Thanks for the feedback. Could you please send a pull request with your suggested changes to the <a href="https://github.com/Slicer/Slicer/blob/main/Docs/user_guide/getting_started.md#linux">linux installation instructions</a>? Be specific about what debian version you use and other specifics about your configuration that may be relevant (usually it is not necessary to manually deal with this dependency).</p>
<p>(see also <a href="https://discourse.slicer.org/t/cant-start-latest-stable-on-ubuntu-20-04/14029/50" class="inline-onebox">Can't start latest stable on ubuntu 20.04 - #50 by swang.jislee</a>)</p>
