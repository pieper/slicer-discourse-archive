<p>Hello!</p>
<p>I have a problem. I do this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Load a 2D image</li>
<li>Create a segmentation in Segment editor (no click on Add)</li>
<li>Then save it to file. (A seg.nrrd is created)</li>
<li>Close the scene</li>
<li>Reload the 2D image, reload the segmentation</li>
<li>Click on Add, a new segment is is created in the loaded segmentation.</li>
<li>Choose the brush, i can draw on the image, but the segment does no appear. It is still empy.<br>
(segmentation and segment are visible, editable area is Everywhere)</li>
</ul>
<p>Can you help me? I am not sure if it is a bug, or I missed something.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>
