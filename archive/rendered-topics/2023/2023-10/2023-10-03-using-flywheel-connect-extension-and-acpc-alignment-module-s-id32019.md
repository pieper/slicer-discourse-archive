<p>Operating system:  MacOS Sonoma 14.0<br>
Slicer version: 5.4.0<br>
Expected behavior:  Recently downloaded Flywheel-Connect Extension so that I could ACPC align brain images and bring Slicer outputs back to Flywheel.<br>
Actual behavior:  I can only go into one module or the other.  How do I stay in the Flywheel Connect extension (module) while simultaneously using the ACPC module?</p>
