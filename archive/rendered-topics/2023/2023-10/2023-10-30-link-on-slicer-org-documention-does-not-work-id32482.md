<p>Hello Y’all,<br>
I just wanted to point out the a link in the webpage <a href="https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/4.1/SlicerApplication/LookupTables" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">here</a> done not work. The link is in the custom LUT section in the second bullet-point for creating a custom LUT.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

<p>The page you have found is for a much older version of Slicer (Slicer-4.1, from many years ago). We’ve put a banner at the top of the page to redirect to the new documentation page, but maybe it was easy to miss.</p>
<p>Have you noticed the banner at the top of the page?<br>
Are you writing because you have not found the information you need on the new documentation site?<br>
What is the specific information you are looking for (creating a new LUT file, creating a new color node in a Python script, …)?</p>

<p>I believe <a class="mention" href="/u/aaron.b.tanenbaum">@aaron.b.tanenbaum</a> was referring to this link which may not be valid anymore:</p>
<p><a href="http://labelpage.halle.us/" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://labelpage.halle.us/</a></p>
<p>I passed the info on to Mike so it can either be fixed or the link can be removed.</p>

<p>Thank you for responding.  I did not notice the banner until now. I will be reviewing the newer documentation at a later time.  I was writing because a link on the page did not word as Steve pointed out.  But looks like you guys are on top of it now.<br>
Cheers!!</p>
