<p>Operating system: Mac OS Ventura 13.5.2<br>
Slicer version: 5.4.0<br>
Expected behavior: Open saved mrml file, or combination of nrrd, transformation and 3d image files with transformation<br>
Actual behavior: When reopening files, the transformation that was done and saved is not able to be reopened. It is something to do with the transition between Mac and Windows. When I duplicated the same steps on a windows computer in the lab, I had no issues.</p>
