<p>So many times (almost always) when I use the “extract center line” function of the VMTK module, the model I used as input surface is blanked (it still appears in DATA, but invisible in any view even with visibility marked on). Why is this happening?<br>
I am u sing the follow workaround:</p>
<ol>
<li>I save the model before extracting the center line;</li>
<li>Then I extract the center line and my model is blanked (invisible);</li>
<li>I load the previously saved model and everything is ok (center line + visible module).</li>
</ol>
<p>Am I doing something wrong, or is it a problem with my CT scan?</p>
<p>Thank you very much again.</p>
