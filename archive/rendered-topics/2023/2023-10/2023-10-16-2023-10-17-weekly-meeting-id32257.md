<p>I would like to show the work I am doing on the Endoscopy fly though.  I have not gotten the <code>vtkMRMLMarkupsPlaneNode</code> to do what I want, so you’ll seem some warts.  I am hoping for your general feedback and, especially, how to fix those warts.  The code itself can be found with the draft <a href="https://github.com/Slicer/Slicer/pull/7165" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Pull Request #7165</a>.  Most places where you see <code>TODO:</code> in the code are places I could especially use some feedback for.  Thanks!</p>

<p>I’m currently trying to use SlicerMorph to register some models and would like to show you some models and ask for advice.</p>
