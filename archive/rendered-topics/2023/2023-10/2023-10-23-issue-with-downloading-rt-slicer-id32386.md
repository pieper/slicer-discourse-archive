<p>I click on install for RT Slicer and it downloads up to, for example, 50% or more or less, and then the download stops And this problem only happens for 5.4.4 version, when I try version 5.2.2, there is no problem and RT Slicer installs easily.</p>

<p>This sounds like a network issue. If download starts but it does not get to the install step, then this seems like a problem outside of Slicer, in the network.</p>
