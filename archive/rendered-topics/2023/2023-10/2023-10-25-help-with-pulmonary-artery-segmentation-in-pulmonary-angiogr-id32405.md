<p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>I’m looking for guidance on segmenting pulmonary arteries in pulmonary angiograms before and after pulmonary embolism. I want to compare their surface area, but I’m unsure how to approach this in a 2D context. Can anyone guide me on how to accurately calculate the surface area of these arteries in a 2D context?</p>
<p>Any advice or resources you can offer would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Thank you for your help.</p>

<p>Some thoughts that Perplexity provides:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.perplexity.ai/search/Help-with-pulmonary-GDiRBcKKRgC5EmrNz2xr4A?s=c" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://www.perplexity.ai/search/Help-with-pulmonary-GDiRBcKKRgC5EmrNz2xr4A?s=c</a></p>
<p>Maybe you need to clarify what you want to achieve and what your radiological material represents.</p>
