<p>Hi ! I’m having trouble with the total segmentator 1, I installed the github, but when I run the heartchambers option, this sign appears:</p>

<p>Do I need to install anything more? Does it happened to any of you? Many thanks for your insight, Mercedes.-</p>

<p>On the GitHub:</p>
<p>The following tasks are freely available only for non-commercial usage (all other tasks can also be used commercially): <code>appendicular_bones</code> , <code>tissue_types</code> , <code>face</code> , <code>heartchambers_highres</code></p>

<p>Apply for a license, they are easy to get for noncommercial use.<br>
Then install 3D Slicer 5.5.0 and the TotalSegmentator v2  extension and feed the license into the program.<br>
Let us hear how that goes.</p>

<p>Hi <a class="mention" href="/u/investigacion_y_des1">@Investigacion_y_des1</a>,</p>
<p>Could you provide a bit more context for this? Are you planning to get an annotated dataset? or you already have some annotations.</p>
<p>In any case, have you considered training an AI model for this specific task using <a href="https://github.com/Project-MONAI/MONAILabel/tree/main" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">MONAI Label</a>?</p>
<p>It is an open-source project and it is part of the MONAI consortium. Here I showed how to organize the dataset and train a model: <a href="https://youtu.be/-HAryYAO5J4?si=uxJPxrDuTDUE-zHr&amp;t=560" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://youtu.be/-HAryYAO5J4?si=uxJPxrDuTDUE-zHr&amp;t=560</a></p>
<p>Let us know</p>
