<p>Is it possible to make a linear length measurement from 3 pts?  First two points define the line and the third point defines the extent of the line. Length would be from the first to last point.</p>
<p>Not sure if this is possible with the current array of markups.</p>

<p>You may investigate if ‘<a href="https://github.com/vmtk/SlicerExtension-VMTK/blob/master/Docs/StenosisMeasurement1D.md" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Stenosis measurement: 1D</a>’ module in SlicerVMTK extension meets your expectations. It is designed for a specific context, but could fit other purposes.</p>
