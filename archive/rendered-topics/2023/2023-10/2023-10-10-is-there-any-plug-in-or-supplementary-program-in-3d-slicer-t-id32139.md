<p>As the title, I hope to find a plug-in that can automatically identify the fat and skeletal muscle components of a certain layer in CT or MRI through 3D slicers, and can tell me the corresponding area or volume.<br>
If someone can tell me the download location of the corresponding plug-in, I would be really grateful, thank you!</p>

<p>There have been lots of papers on that topic, but none that I’m aware of have made their work available.  It would be great if someone knows of one.</p>

<p>This is indeed an extension feature that the 3D Slicer software urgently needs.</p>
