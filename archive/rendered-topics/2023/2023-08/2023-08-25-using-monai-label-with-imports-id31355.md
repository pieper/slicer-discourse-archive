<p>Hi,<br>
I am new to Monai Label but am familiar enough with the process of running the algorithm for segmentation learning. However, I have been trying to upload my own labels for training but have had no success. With the draw tool, the labels are visible but when I upload a label generated beforehand it is not visible on the volume. Additionally, when I submit the label and go to train, there is no progress made in the learning. I feel I may be doing something wrong so any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!</p>
