<p>Hi, maybe the link was temporarily not working. But I’ve just tried it from this page: <a href="https://www.slicerigt.org/wp/user-tutorial/" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">User tutorial | SlicerIGT</a> and it is working now. The link is under “Download sample data”. Could you please try to download it again?</p>
