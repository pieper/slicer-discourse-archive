<p>Dear developers，<br>
I want to upload the extension created by myself, <a href="https://github.com/Slicer/ExtensionsIndex/blob/main/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md#todo-list-for-submitting-a-new-extension" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">ExtensionsIndex/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md at main · Slicer/ExtensionsIndex · GitHub</a><br>
Is this the tutorial about how to making it?<br>
Best wishes,<br>
Joshua</p>

<p>Yes that checklist is helpful; there is also this description of the release process: <a href="https://slicer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer_guide/extensions.html#distribute-an-extension" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Extensions — 3D Slicer documentation</a></p>

<p>Thanks, I also wonder how to do it offline to just test the extension on my own computer, is there any tutorial?</p>
