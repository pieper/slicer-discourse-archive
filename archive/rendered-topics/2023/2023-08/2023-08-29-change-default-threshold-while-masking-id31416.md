<p>Operating system: Windows<br>
Slicer version: 5.0.3</p>
<p>I have multiple labels to be annotated in a CT volume. I use the Threshold tool followed by “Use for Masking” to paint the region of interest (ROI) .<br>
I want to know if there is a way to</p>
<ol>
<li>preset the range of threshold say 100 HU to 1000 HU so that the annotator need not change it every time he/she clicks the Threshold button.<br>
Further, the threshold changes to default every time the label is changed. So, the threshold needs to be modified every time. is there a way to prevent this?</li>
<li>preset the brush diameter that is used for masking? It is 3% by default. Would like to change it to smaller diameter, say 1%.</li>
</ol>
