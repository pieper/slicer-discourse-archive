<p>I am trying to train a model for Lung Tumor segmentation but the dice values and the model accuracy is 0. Any way of solving this problem?</p>

<p>Hi <a class="mention" href="/u/a_by">@A_By</a>,</p>
<p>It isn’t easy to help without dataset details and steps you follow.<br>
I’d suggest opening a discussion on the MONAI Label repository (<a href="https://github.com/Project-MONAI/MONAILabel/discussions" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Project-MONAI/MONAILabel · Discussions · GitHub</a>) with more details about the steps you followed for training and the dataset you are using.</p>
