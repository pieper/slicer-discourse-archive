<p>Operating system: Windows11<br>
Slicer version: Slicer 5.2.2<br>
Expected behavior:<br>
"I want to explore the differences in the morphology between groups using the Shape Variation Analyzer. To achieve this, I want to generate shape datasets compatible with this analysis using SPHARM-PDM.<br>
Actual behavior:  I am facing difficulties with GenParaMesh as it seems to be stuck in a continuous calculation process. When I use the data importer to read the VTK files, the consistency appears to be maintained. However, when I check the ‘Use as template’ option, inconsistencies arise.The shape topology is in the form of a sphere. I need your help, please.</p>
