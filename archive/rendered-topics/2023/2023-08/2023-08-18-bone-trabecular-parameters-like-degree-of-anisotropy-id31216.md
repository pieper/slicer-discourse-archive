<p>Hi, I was wondering if BoneTextureExtension people or anyone tell me more about the current usefulness of 3D Slicer for measuring bone trabecular microstructure parameters like bone volume fraction and degree of anisotropy. I have followed the steps in the materials posted to GitHub but the variables are not calculated. Do you have any videos or step-by-step guides for making the plug-in work? I know BoneJ2 in ImageJ/FIJI can calculate these but I am interested in 3D Slicer as it seems to have some advantages. I also wonder if there is an optimal way to combine the use of ImageJ and 3D Slicer for investigating bone microanatomy.</p>
