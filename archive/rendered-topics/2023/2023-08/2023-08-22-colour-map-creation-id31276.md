<p>Operating system: Macbook pro<br>
Slicer version: 5.2.2<br>
Expected behavior: Colour map creation when loading the output file (created from model to model distance) in the ShapePopulationViewer module<br>
Actual behavior: It just keeps loading. Am I missing something? Is there a step I skipped?</p>
