<p>Hi,<br>
Is it possible to make the “background” segment overlap and “seed” segment overite all segments in the same time?<br>
I wanna use this tool for eraser some structures form my segmentation. “Seed” would overwrite my main segment and erase part I want to delete, but how to prevent background segment from overwriting everything else?<br>
Thank you in advance!<br>
KW</p>
