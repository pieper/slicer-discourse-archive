<p>Hello, I’m doing a manual segmentation in 3D slicer and I made a mistake with the brush tool, how can i undo this action? There’s a yellow button in the segmentation module that seems to be an “undo option” but it doesn’t erase what I just drew in the image, there has to be a way to erase what you draw, just like in paint. Please help.</p>

    If you press the “undo” option and then move your mouse do you see it undo in the slice views? I have observed cases where pressing undo does not update the slice view until you move your mouse.

<p>Did you happen to see my response on the other thread you posted on? Could you reply to my comment here so we can learn more details?</p>
