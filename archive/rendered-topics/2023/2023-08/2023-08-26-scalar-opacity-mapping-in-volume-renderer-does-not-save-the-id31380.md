<p>Hi,<br>
I use midpoint and sharpness of midpoint in the scalar opacity mapping window in the volume renderer advanced option. It works ok.<br>
When I save the scene and reload it - these values are not saved, so the 3D rendering is different from what I saved.<br>
Can you add these parameters to the saved scene?<br>
Thx,<br>
Gal.</p>
