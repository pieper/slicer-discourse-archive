<p>Can anyone help me with how the Resection Volume plugin works?<br>
I am not able to find any tutorial for the plugin only some screenshots of the output on the documentation.<br>
As it mentioned I added 4 point list on the model to generate a label map but the plugin only takes 1 point list at a time.<br>
I don’t know if there is a way to merge all point list to 1 label and give it as input to generate the 3D surface.</p>
<p>Apologize, if its some basic steps and am unaware about it.</p>
<p>It would be really helpful, if someone has already worked on this plugin could help me.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
