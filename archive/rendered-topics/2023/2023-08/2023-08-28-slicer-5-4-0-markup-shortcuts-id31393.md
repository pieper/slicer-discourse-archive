<p>Hi, there seems to be some shortcut changes within the markerup module between the slicer 5.2.2 and 5.4.0. E.g. in 5.2.2, one can add new control points using shortcut (ctrl + shift+ spacebar) and you cannot do the same in 5.4.0. Can someone please advise. Thanks.</p>

<p>Thanks Murat, I have retested. Win 11+ slicer 5.4.0 do not work. Someone, please advise. Thanks.</p>

<p>Actually it works for me on windows 10 with 5.4.0. However, there is indeed an issue.</p>
<p>You can see that the mouse icon changes to placement mode when hit CTRL+SHIFT+SPACE, but you cannot click exactly at that point. You have to jiggle mouse and then you can click, which obviously defeat the purpose of this function. I have seen this behavior before, and thought it was fixed.</p>
