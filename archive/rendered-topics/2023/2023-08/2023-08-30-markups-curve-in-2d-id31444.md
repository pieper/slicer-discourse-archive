<p>Hello everyone.</p>
<p>I am trying to draw a Markups curve in 2D ( a plane curve). Is it possible to constrain Slicer 3D to draw the curve in 2D instead of 3D? Thanks.</p>

<p>Everything in Slicer is in 3D (hence 3D Slicer). Having said that if you draw the curve in a slice view, one of the coordinates (depending on the which view you choose) will be fixed, effectively being a 2D curve (with 3 coordinates).</p>
<p>Why do you need to draw your curve 2D?</p>

<p>Thank you for your response.  I am new to this software. I need to perform a 2D cut from a 3D object and then export it to cut it later in a laser cutting machine.  Thanks</p>
