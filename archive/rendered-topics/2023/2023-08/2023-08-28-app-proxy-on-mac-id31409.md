<p>In simple directions how do I add a proxy to 3D Slicer on the Mac, our internal app proxy is different from our internal system proxy and I don’t know how to add the internal app proxy for 3D Slicer.<br>
For the life of me, I cannot figure out how to add a proxy to the software on my Mac, ive read some articles and still they don’t make any sense to me.<br>
Thanks in advance.</p>
