<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I’m new to using VMTK and I’ve unfortunately run into an issue with attempting to open the Pypepad using the Anaconda prompt. Every time I run the “vmtk-exe.py” line (as shown in the tutorials on the VMTK website), a separate prompt opens and immediately closes with the Anaconda prompt displaying my working directory on a new line below, indicating nothing happened. I’ve tried to reinstall VMTK with no luck and am uncertain as to what the issue is. Help would much be appreciated.</p>
