<p>I want to use VR to guide needles that puncture into tumors.</p>

<p>Hello, could you be more specific in what you’re saying? For example, the specific process you want to achieve. Generally, assisted puncture requires binocular optical positioning and robotic arm assistance, as well as other equipment that can accurately locate the puncture needle. As for VR, it is rarely used for surgical assistance. I have seen some applications of AR for related work before</p>
