<p>We are excited to invite you to participate in the upcoming “Office Hour” sessions for SlicerAutoscoperM! As we strive to build a collaborative community, your input is crucial in shaping the development process.</p>
<p>The Office Hour sessions aim to create a platform where we can come together as a community to discuss ideas, share knowledge, and address questions related to SlicerAutoscoperM. These sessions will be an opportunity to interact with the core development team, learn about the project’s roadmap, and explore potential areas of contribution.</p>

<p>Hi <a class="mention" href="/u/mau_igna_06">@mau_igna_06</a> , we haven’t started office hour sessions just yet- but you can test out the sample data following along with <a href="https://autoscoper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started.html#installing-autoscoperm" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">one of our tutorials</a>.  Are you a current Autoscoper user? BVR tracking?</p>

<p>Thank you. I have a lot on my plate with my formal job, <a href="https://github.com/SlicerIGT/SlicerBoneReconstructionPlanner#bonereconstructionplanner" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">BoneReconstructionPlanner</a> on weekends and, currently, using my free time on a telemetry extension</p>
<p>I’ll probably wait till there is a demo from the software creators if any <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>
