<p>Good morning.<br>
I am a new student to 3D sclicer.</p>
<p>I am using 3D sclicer for masking,<br>
I am looking for hotkeys to change the painting and erasing modes.</p>
<p>It is very difficult to change the mode by pressing the mouse every time.</p>
<p>Please help me out.</p>

<p>There are <a href="https://slicer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/modules/segmenteditor.html#keyboard-shortcuts">hotkeys already available for many functions during segmentation</a> but you can <a href="https://slicer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer_guide/script_repository.html#keyboard-shortcuts-and-mouse-gestures">add more custom shortcuts for any features</a> by adding a few lines to your Slicer startup file. If you need any help with adding a shortcut to any specific feature then let us know.</p>
<p>You can automate not just simple steps, but you can also add shortcuts that perform a series of tasks that you need to do frequently.</p>
