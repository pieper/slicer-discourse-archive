<p>Hello everyone. I’m trying to segment nasal masses with 3d Slicer. I tried many tools through the segment editor. I want to manipulate the segmentation I created using the “fill between slices” tool. but when I try to delete an over segmented area the eraser does not work and when I use scissors it affects the whole segmentation. how do i get past this? thanks</p>
