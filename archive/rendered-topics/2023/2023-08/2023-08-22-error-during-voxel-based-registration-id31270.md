<p>Hello 3d slicer forum, I have a problem that I hope someone can help me with.</p>
<p>I am trying to do a growing voxel based registration based on the cranial base on a patient ( I am using the CMF registration extension ).</p>
<p>So I load both the fixed scans and the segmentations of of the scans, the files all load correctly and the registration seems like it is running smoothly until a pop up that says “completed with errors” comes up and describes a growing registration error.</p>
<p>the pop up looks like this<br>
<div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://us1.discourse-cdn.com/flex002/uploads/slicer/original/3X/3/2/32277f52631bee3302cdb33a89e42f456c3e67fb.jpeg" data-download-href="/uploads/short-url/79GuLpSYXZwK6LRtsojCgbVc4pd.jpeg?dl=1" title="WhatsApp Image 2023-08-21 at 18.15.51" rel="noopener nofollow ugc"><img src="https://us1.discourse-cdn.com/flex002/uploads/slicer/optimized/3X/3/2/32277f52631bee3302cdb33a89e42f456c3e67fb_2_375x500.jpeg" alt="WhatsApp Image 2023-08-21 at 18.15.51" data-base62-sha1="79GuLpSYXZwK6LRtsojCgbVc4pd" width="375" height="500" srcset="https://us1.discourse-cdn.com/flex002/uploads/slicer/optimized/3X/3/2/32277f52631bee3302cdb33a89e42f456c3e67fb_2_375x500.jpeg, https://us1.discourse-cdn.com/flex002/uploads/slicer/optimized/3X/3/2/32277f52631bee3302cdb33a89e42f456c3e67fb_2_562x750.jpeg 1.5x, https://us1.discourse-cdn.com/flex002/uploads/slicer/optimized/3X/3/2/32277f52631bee3302cdb33a89e42f456c3e67fb_2_750x1000.jpeg 2x" data-dominant-color="7D7878"><div class="meta"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use href="#far-image"></use></svg><span class="filename">WhatsApp Image 2023-08-21 at 18.15.51</span><span class="informations">960×1280 217 KB</span><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use href="#discourse-expand"></use></svg></div></a></div></p>
<p>Is anyone familiar with this error? I cant figure out what I am doing wrong.</p>
<p>I thank you all in advance.</p>

<p>I had this error but it was gone once I used another computer with higher specs.</p>
