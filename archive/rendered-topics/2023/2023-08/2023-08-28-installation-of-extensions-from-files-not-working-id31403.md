<p>Hi,<br>
I have a stand-alone computer with no internet connection, which I want to add extensions to. The downloaded extension files are installed but the functionality in Slicer is missing.<br>
Also when I click “more…” in the extension manager i get the following error:<br>
“Extensions can not be installed.<br>
Failed to load extension page using this URL: <a href="https://extensions.slicer.org/catalog/All/31938/win" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">@KitwareMedical/slicer-extensions-webapp</a><br>
Check that 3D Slicer is properly installed. Read more…”</p>
<p>This happens with several extensions such as “SegmentEditorExtraEffects” “AirwaySegmentation” and " “MarkupsToModel”</p>
<p>A test on another computer had the same results, but when established an internet connection an extra download was done. Still extensions do not work.<br>
Thank you<br>
Gal.</p>
