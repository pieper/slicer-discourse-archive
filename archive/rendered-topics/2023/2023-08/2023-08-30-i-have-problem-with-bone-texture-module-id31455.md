<p>Hello everyone.<br>
I’m trying to get bone morphometry features using bone texture module.<br>
Using the crop volume, the 75x75x75um image was cropped with a 2x2x2um size ROI.<br>
The threshold value was obtained using the segment editor.<br>
Binaryization was performed using the Threshold scalar volume.<br>
I tried to get BM figures from bone texture for the binarized image, but only zero values came out.<br>
How can I solve this problem</p>
