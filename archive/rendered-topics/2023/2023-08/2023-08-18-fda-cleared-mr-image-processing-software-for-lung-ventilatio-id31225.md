<p>As you all know, 3D Slicer stands tall in its threefold capabilities.</p>
<p>Firstly, as a clinical research tool akin to a radiology workstation, it offers advanced visualization, segmentation, and registration methodologies for various application domains.</p>
<p>Secondly, as a programming platform, it facilitates the translation and evaluation of novel quantitative methods, allowing biomedical researchers to concentrate on algorithm implementation while managing data communication, visualization, and user interface development.</p>
<p>Lastly, as a product platform, it offers a launchpad for startups and medium-sized companies to swiftly develop, deploy, and pursue FDA approval for software as a medical device (SaMD) applications.</p>
<p>On this note, I am pleased to share with you the news of an FDA Cleared MR image processing software tailored for lung ventilation imaging that was developed using 3D Slicer.  You can read about it here.</p>
