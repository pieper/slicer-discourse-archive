<p>Hi everyone,<br>
I have got a series of mammography and ultrasound images that I segmented by 3d slicer. I want to extract selected segments using the codes below:<br>
<div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://us1.discourse-cdn.com/flex002/uploads/slicer/original/3X/3/f/3f5e3b97534b926a18fb1a7ba8534f642ab792ce.png" data-download-href="/uploads/short-url/92zYlStNx5dwPfHV0WcKGy5xpEO.png?dl=1" title="Screenshot (233)"><img src="https://us1.discourse-cdn.com/flex002/uploads/slicer/optimized/3X/3/f/3f5e3b97534b926a18fb1a7ba8534f642ab792ce_2_690x289.png" alt="Screenshot (233)" data-base62-sha1="92zYlStNx5dwPfHV0WcKGy5xpEO" width="690" height="289" srcset="https://us1.discourse-cdn.com/flex002/uploads/slicer/optimized/3X/3/f/3f5e3b97534b926a18fb1a7ba8534f642ab792ce_2_690x289.png, https://us1.discourse-cdn.com/flex002/uploads/slicer/optimized/3X/3/f/3f5e3b97534b926a18fb1a7ba8534f642ab792ce_2_1035x433.png 1.5x, https://us1.discourse-cdn.com/flex002/uploads/slicer/original/3X/3/f/3f5e3b97534b926a18fb1a7ba8534f642ab792ce.png 2x" data-dominant-color="F4F3F3"><div class="meta"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use href="#far-image"></use></svg><span class="filename">Screenshot (233)</span><span class="informations">1055×443 35.8 KB</span><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use href="#discourse-expand"></use></svg></div></a></div><br>
However, I do not have any “SegmentationExtracted.seg.nrrd” file to load in python.<br>
Can anyone guide me how to use these codes?</p>

<p>Hi,<br>
I sent you a question about how to extract selected segments by the codes that I have sent to you, however it was accidentally rejected while reviewing the moderation queue.I would be greatly thankful if you answer my question.</p>

<p>This is a placeholder for the file system path to the file where you saved your segmentation.</p>
