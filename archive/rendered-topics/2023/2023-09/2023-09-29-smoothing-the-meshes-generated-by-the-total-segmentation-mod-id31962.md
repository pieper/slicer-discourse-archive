<p>Hello everyone,<br>
I’m currently using the Total Segmentation module and gaining valuable insights into the anatomy of different organs. I’m curious about your recommendations for an effective smoothing filter to prevent the visibility of the vowelized meshes (see attached image). I experimented with the Surface Toolbox module, testing various parameters like Laplace, tabuing, and iterations, but unfortunately, I couldn’t achieve the desired level of smoothing<br>

<p>You can use the <code>Joint smoothing</code> method in Segment Editor module’s Smoothing effect.</p>
<p>Cropping and resampling the input CT to have isotropic spacing (and maybe slightly smaller voxels) and disabling “fast mode” will also make the surfaces smoother.</p>
