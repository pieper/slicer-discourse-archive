<p>Dear researchers, does anyone know why the software is not responding when trying to use 800 landmark points in phase 2 for 8 models of tibial bone in Auto3DGM?</p>
<p>I use Intel i7 13th gen and RTX4090; is that not enough?</p>

<p><a class="mention" href="/u/zariliusra">@zariliusra</a> I don’t think auto3Dgm uses GPU at all. Everything is done on the CPU. As far as I know the authors of the auto3Dgm does not track this forum, you might have better luck if you contact them directly at <a href="https://toothandclaw.github.io/contact/" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Contact - Slicer Auto3dgm</a></p>
<p>For large project, I believe people use HPC clusters.</p>
