<p>Hello !</p>
<p>I want to develop an extension that will have a custom view. The view consist of three 3D views side by side. In one view I want to have a source model, in the second view I want to have the target model and in the third view both source and target with the result.<br>
Is there documentation that could help me achieve this ?</p>
<p>Thank you very much.</p>
