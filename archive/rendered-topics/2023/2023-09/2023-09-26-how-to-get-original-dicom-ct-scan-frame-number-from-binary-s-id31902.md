<p>Hi all – I am working on a deep learning framework for liver metastasis. I have the original DICOM CT of the abdomen and pelvis and a binary segmentation mask of the liver alone. I would like to pass axial images of JUST the liver segmentation to an LSTM network however I am having difficulty extracting frames of just the liver using the binary segmentation mask.</p>
<p>If there are tutorials available with a similar issue I would greatly appreciate the help. Thank you in advance.</p>
