<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I’m new to Slicer. I have a question regarding DICOM database. I am trying to import MRI/PET scans of several patients from a disk format and all images have been anonymised. On Slicer, all the imaging studies have been imported and collated under the same patient labeled “Removed”. Is it possible to “Create” different patients, so that respective patient studies aren’t mixed together under the one patient?</p>
<p>Operating system: Windows 11<br>
Slicer version: 5.4.0<br>
Expected behavior:<br>
Actual behavior:</p>
