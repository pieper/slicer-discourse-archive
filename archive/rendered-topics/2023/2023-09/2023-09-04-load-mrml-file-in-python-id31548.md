<p>Hello!</p>
<p>I’m a new user of Slicer. I’m currently busy applying a machine learning method to an MRI dataset, which contains also .mrml files with volumes such as segmentations etc… I’d like to open these .mrml files in python as numpy arrays directly from a Jupyter notebook. Is this possible? If yes would it be possible to have a small script to do it?<br>
Thanks in advance!</p>
