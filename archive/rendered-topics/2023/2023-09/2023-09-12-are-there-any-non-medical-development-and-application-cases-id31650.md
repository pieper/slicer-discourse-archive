<p>3D Slicer has been used for geoscience (<a href="http://www.ltrace.com.br/geoslicer/" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">GeoSlicer – LTrace Geophysical Solutions</a>) and also Astronomy (<a href="https://github.com/Punzo/SlicerAstro" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">GitHub - Punzo/SlicerAstro: Astronomy (HI) extension for 3DSlicer (https://www.slicer.org/)</a>) purposes.</p>

<p>After looking through these cases, I think it’s great and cheer for your outstanding work.<br>
Do I also want to develop my application based on 3D SLICER, but I don’t know how to do it.  Even though I have raised many questions and consulted many materials, I still have no idea. How should I proceed next？</p>
