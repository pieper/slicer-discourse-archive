<p>Hi! Previously i have used the mask volume tool to export a segment into volume renderings. However, i found in the newest slicer version (5.4) when i use mask volume nothing is showing up in the volume rendering. any thoughts?</p>

<p>Have you checked the dropdown in Volume Rendering to see if the new volume is in the list? You might need to actually select it then enable visibility.</p>
