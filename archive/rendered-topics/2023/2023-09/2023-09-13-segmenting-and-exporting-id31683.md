<p>Good morning,</p>
<p>I am new to the 3D Sliver and tried to figure out some functionalities about exporting and image processing. Can you help me find out, if there is any possibility in 3D slicer including extensions to do the following tasks?</p>
<ul>
<li>Importing DICOM Videos</li>
<li>Marking a certain frame as endsystolic and enddiastolic frame</li>
<li>do area and length measurements in these images</li>
<li>segment the area measurements with one length line and a certain amount of vertical lines: best would be to both have a freehand tool (atrium) and a Simpsons tool (left ventricle) for this</li>
<li>export the coordinates of these lines in an excel format</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you very much for your help and best regards!<br>
Theo</p>
