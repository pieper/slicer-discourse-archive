<p>Hi</p>
<p>I am trying to reconstruct 3d heart model from cineMRI data. I have followed the steps from " Reconstruct 4D volume from cine-MRI frames".<br>
now I have 5 volume sequence exported in .NRRD format</p>
<ol>
<li>AOT trufi cine - 25 frames volume sequnce by InstanceNumber</li>
<li>4 CH trufi cine - 25 frames volume sequnce by InstanceNumber</li>
<li>3 CH trufi cine - 25 frames volume sequnce by InstanceNumber</li>
<li>2 CH trufi cine - 25 frames volume sequnce by InstanceNumber</li>
<li>SAX trufi cine - 25 frames volume sequnce by InstanceNumber</li>
</ol>
<p>I have to reconstruct 3d heart model so how should I proceed further.<br>
How I can create one sequence volume for further segmentation at each time frame</p>
<p>Thank You</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>can anyone help me to build single sequence volume for model segmentation from 5 time series mentioned in above post.</p>

<p>I am struck at this point. How to generate single volume for segmentation from the above 5 volume sequences. Please guide me further</p>
