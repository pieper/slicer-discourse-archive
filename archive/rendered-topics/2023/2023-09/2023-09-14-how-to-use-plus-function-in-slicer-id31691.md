<p>Hello everyone, I hope to use some of the functions of ultrasound images provided by PLUS, such as ultrasound calibration, in the compiled Slicer environment.</p>
<p>My current idea is to call the PLUS function in the source code of the plug-in in the form of a Slicer plug-in. I wonder if you have any relevant experience. How should I implement this idea? Do you have any good suggestions?</p>
<p>If the PLUS-related source code is compiled into a static library, and the functions in the static library are called in the Slicer plug-in,      is this idea feasible and how to implement it specifically?</p>
