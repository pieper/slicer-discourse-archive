<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>I am recalculating the slice views to see a line in two parallel and one perpendicular view. In the perpendicular view, there is a weird bug that the slice intersections are broken or refracted (see the screenshot below). After I hover with the mouse above the (yellow) slice view, the lines straighten again.</p>
<p>Can someone explain the bug? And if I can somehow get rid of it? The weird thing is, that it happens only in the perpendicular (yellow) slice view.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>
