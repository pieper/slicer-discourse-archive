<p>Hi,<br>
I am using MonaiLable for auto segementation of whole body, there is a drop down in the extension “Auto Segmentaion”. So when we connect it to the server of Monai, the pre trained model will display over it. But today when I am trying its not dispalying. Can you please help me out with this.<br>
I also need one more help, can anyone suggest me how I can label body parts in ct scan automatically. It would be great if I get response asap.</p>
