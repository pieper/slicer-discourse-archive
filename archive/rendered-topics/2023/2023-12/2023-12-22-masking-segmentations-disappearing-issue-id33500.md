<p>When I am segmenting, sometimes it will disappear on me. I can see it in the 3D area but not in any of slices. Sometimes, this will happen after I apply thresholding, and other times, it appears to occur randomly. Is there a setting or method to resolve this? Thank you!</p>

<p>Can you describe the circumstances that lead to the segment not being visible?</p>
<p>Perhaps you are seeing the same thing as this issue: <a href="https://github.com/Slicer/Slicer/issues/6874" class="inline-onebox">Segment disappears after threshold effect preview; two widgets · Issue #6874 · Slicer/Slicer · GitHub</a></p>
