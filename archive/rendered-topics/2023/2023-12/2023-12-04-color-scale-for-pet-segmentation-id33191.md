<p>Hi, I’d like to know how to use a color scale “Rainbow” typically used in PET interpretation software. I am intending to delineate tumors on PET PSMA but need to have the window set at Rainbow for standardisation and to follow PET reporting guidelines</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>choose the volumes module—and set your active volume with PET images, and then you can select Lookup Table—PET-rainbow style.</p>
