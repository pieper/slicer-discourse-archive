<p>I am using a workstation with multi graphic cards. when slicer starts up, there is an error , Graphics capabilities of this computer: Renderer does not support required OpenGL capabilities.</p>
<p>as the message said, <a href="https://slicer.readthedocs.io/en/v5.6/user_guide/get_help.html#slicer-application-does-not-start" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Get Help — 3D Slicer documentation</a></p>
<p>i download mesa, but it only works in slicer 5.4,but not other versions, how to solve this problem?</p>
