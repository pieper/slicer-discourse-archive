<p>Hi everyone! i’m new in the field of radioomics and i have a couple of questions! .</p>
<ol>
<li>First of all, I have 10 18F-DOPA PET SUVr images and they all have a different [min, max] range. I want to set a fixed bin width to have 64 as the bin count for all images. So I’m setting a different bin width for all images. Is this correct or do I need to set a fixed bin width for all images?</li>
<li>All the images have anisotropic voxels (1.171875, 1.171875, 3.2700042724609375), but i think it would be better to have isotropic voxels…is it feasible to consider for example (2,2,2) ?<br>
Thanks in advance!!!</li>
</ol>
