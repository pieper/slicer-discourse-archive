<p>Hello,</p>
<p>pretty new to slicer!</p>
<p>I wanted to ask if it was allowed to use the sample data provided by slicer 3D (in this case Head MRI 1) to generate images and use them in a publication?</p>
<p>Best regards and thank you for your support!</p>

<p>Yes, data contributed to / distributed with Slicer is covered by <a href="https://github.com/Slicer/Slicer/blob/main/License.txt">the License</a> which allows general reuse.  A citation is always appreciated.</p>

<p>You can find additional notes for some data sets in the Sample Data module’s <code>Acknowledgement</code> section (you can find it at the top of the module panel).</p>
