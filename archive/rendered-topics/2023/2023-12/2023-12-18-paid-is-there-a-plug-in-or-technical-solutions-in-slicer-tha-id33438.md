<p>Our customer wants to add a function of using ultrasonic equipment to measure temperature, but I don’t know how to do it. If there is a plug-in or technical solution that can solve this problem, our customer is willing to pay for it and establish long-term technical cooperation. Interested individuals or organizations can send me an in-site message. Thanks to the platform provided by the Slicer community.</p>
