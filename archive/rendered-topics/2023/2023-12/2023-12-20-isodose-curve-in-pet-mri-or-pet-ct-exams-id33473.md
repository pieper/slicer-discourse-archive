<p>Hey everyone.<br>
I would like to create isodose curves and DHV histograms from PET CT or PET MRI exams for treating a liver lesion (SIRT).<br>
When uploading the exam in the database, I can’t reach out the RT segmentation extension.<br>
Did anyone had the experience for extracting isodose curve after SIRT?<br>
Thank you</p>

<p>Hey everyone and happy new year,<br>
When uploading the woke PET MRI exam, I can’t extract the isodose curve with the RT extension</p>

<p>I’m sorry but we cannot give you answers without you giving us information about your problem. Please describe what you tried to do and why it didn’t work. Screenshots would help too.</p>
