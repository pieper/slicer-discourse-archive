<p>Hi</p>
<p>For my Master Thesis I was planning to use 3D slicer to segment the thorax and heart from a CT scan of a male young adult in order to 3D print models of it. For this, I am still searching for a proper public available CT scan. I saw that 3D slicer has some built-in sample data, under which the CTACardio DICOM file. If I would like to use this in my thesis scription, I should refer to the source of this data. Which reference should I use for this?</p>
<p>Thank you in advance</p>
