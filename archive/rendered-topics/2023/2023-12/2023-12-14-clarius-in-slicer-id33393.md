<p>Hello, I have connected the Clarius C3 HD3 to Slicer via the Plus Toolkit. According to the video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vXeJxYFou4&amp;t=4s" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vXeJxYFou4&amp;t=4s</a>, I expected the live image in the 3D view to rearrange itself while moving the scanner. I have also activated the IMU data transfer. Is there another setting that I am not aware of? Should this work?  Thank you!</p>
