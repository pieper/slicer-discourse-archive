<p>Hi Everyone!<br>
I´m trying to build a Custom App with SlicerCustomAppTemplate in Windows 11 with VS 2022 and Qt5.15.2 and I get this error:</p>
<p>CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:890 (find_package):<br>
33&gt; By not providing “FindCTK.cmake” in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has<br>
33&gt; asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by “CTK”, but<br>
33&gt; CMake did not find one.<br>
33&gt;<br>
33&gt; Could not find a package configuration file provided by “CTK” with any of<br>
33&gt; the following names:<br>
33&gt;<br>
33&gt; CTKConfig.cmake<br>
33&gt; ctk-config.cmake<br>
33&gt;<br>
33&gt; Add the installation prefix of “CTK” to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set “CTK_DIR”<br>
33&gt; to a directory containing one of the above files. If “CTK” provides a<br>
33&gt; separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been installed.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>
