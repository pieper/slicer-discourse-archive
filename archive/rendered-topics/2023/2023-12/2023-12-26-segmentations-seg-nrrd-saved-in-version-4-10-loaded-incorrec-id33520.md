<p>I had segmentations done in version 4.10, however, trying to load them in version 5.6 has the segmentations scales and positioned incorrectly relative to the input image. How do I resolve this issue so that I can use my segmentations with newer versions of slicer?</p>

<p>If you load the same segmentation back to 4.10 does it work? What is the format you saved the segmentation into? Can you show us screenshots about the right and the wrong positioning? Thanks</p>
