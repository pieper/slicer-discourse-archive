<p>Hi,<br>
I use slicer to display some dicom files (3D scans) and save them as a nrrd file.<br>
The nrrd file is too big for me, I need to crop this file around the center of the cube.<br>
How can I do this?</p>
<p>I need to do for at least 300 Dicom file, is there a way to automate the process to deal with this amount of file? by writing a python script for instance?<br>
Thanks for any pointers or advice to do this.</p>
