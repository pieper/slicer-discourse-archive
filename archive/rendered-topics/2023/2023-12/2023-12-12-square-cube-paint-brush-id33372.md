<p>Hi, I am wondering if anyone has been able to implement a square/cube brush for “Paint” in “Segmentation Editor”. Thanks.</p>

<p>You can kind of already do this using the scissors tool. Use “Fill Inside”, “Rectangle”, and “Symmetric”, and pick how “thick” you want the painted area to be.</p>

<p>I have wanted in the past a cylindrical brush and it would be great if its shape could geodesically warp an existing segment</p>

<p>You can do a cylindrical operation using scissors with symmetric as well, and even draw arbitrary shapes.</p>
<p>I’m not sure what you mean by “geodesically warp an existing segment”.</p>

<p>I have requested this before because I was used to Mimics having both circle and square!</p>
