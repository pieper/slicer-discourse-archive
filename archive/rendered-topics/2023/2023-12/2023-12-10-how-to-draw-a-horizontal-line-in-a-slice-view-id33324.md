<p>I want that the line to occupy the entire width of the view, and still occupy the entire width when zooming and panning.<br>
At the same time, the line should move as the image moves.</p>

<p>Did you try the line tool?</p>

<p>Do you mean the line markup?<br>
I know the tool. But it can only be drawn with two endpoints.<br>
I want the line to be of infinite length. (like the crosschair)<br>
Thanks!</p>
