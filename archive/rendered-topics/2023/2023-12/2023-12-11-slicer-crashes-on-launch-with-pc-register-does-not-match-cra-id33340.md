<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Just purchased a new macbook Air G2 under macOs Sonoma 14.0 and re-installed slic3r. When launching the app, it crashes immediately (doesn’t even open a window). In the crash report, I get a “PC register does not match crashing frame” error.</p>
<p>It may not be linked but I initially migrated the app from my old macbook pro, which carried the setting files along. After my issues, I deleted the whole slic3r settings folder in application support folder. But it did not solve the issue.</p>
<p>Any idea would be very appreciated<br>
thanks<br>
Eric</p>

<p>Wrong forum - this is for 3D Slicer, not slic3r</p>
