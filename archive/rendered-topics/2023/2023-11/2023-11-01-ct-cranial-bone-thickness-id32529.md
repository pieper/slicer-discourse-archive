<p>Hi:</p>
<p>I have two different populations (cranial CT images). I want to compute the bone thickness of each one, and then I want to do a comparison between both populations. How can I do that? Any 3D slicer extension? Or other free software? I tried to use Bone Thockness mapping extension with different 3D slicer versions, but I didn’t got any good result.</p>
<p>Sincerely</p>
