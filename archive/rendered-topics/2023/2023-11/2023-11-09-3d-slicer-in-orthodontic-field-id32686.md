<p>hello, i want to use 3D slicer for Orthodontic purposes,<br>
i want to measure the surface dimensional accuracy between two stl files data.<br>
the first file is a 3d scanned dental model, the other file is a 3d scanned clear aligner</p>
<p>as you know the clear aligner device have two surfaces, outer surface and inner surface (the surface that is in a direct contact with the teeth)</p>
<p>in other software like Geomagic control; i can separately measure the surface differences between the inner surface of the aligner and the teeth of the 3d dental model.</p>
<p>i want to know if this is possible to do with 3d slicer,<br>
can i remove the outer surface of the aligner from measurements and keep only the inner surface.</p>
<p>thank you,</p>
