<p>I would like to ask for the error that occured in loading files.</p>
<p>I worked with the 5.4.0 version and processed Dicom files.</p>
<p>After processing, i tried to load the files at another computer with the 5.4.0 version.</p>
<p>But error occured.<br>
As mentioned ‘Error occured while loading selected files’</p>
<p>Would you do me a favor to solve the error</p>
