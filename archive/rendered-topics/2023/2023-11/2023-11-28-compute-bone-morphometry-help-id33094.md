<p>Hi Everyone,</p>
<p>I am having trouble with the compute bone morphometry features module. I segment bone using threshold for masking and then make my selection, convert the segment to a binary label map, then select the parent CT scan as the input volume, and the segment label as the input mask.</p>
<p>I am consistently getting “1” for Percent Bone Volume, and “0” for Tb Separation. However, on some scans, these variables return the expected values. I can’t figure out why some scans are returning values and some are not. Everything is identical between the scans and the workflow. I haven’t found the module’s tutorial to be helpful.</p>
<p>Any help would be enormously appreciated!</p>
<p>Jamie</p>
