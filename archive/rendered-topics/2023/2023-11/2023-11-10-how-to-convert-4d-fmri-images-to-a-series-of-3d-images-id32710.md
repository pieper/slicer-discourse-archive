<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am working with the ADHD200 dataset. It consists of anatomical and resting state fMRI images in <code>NIFTI (nii.gz)</code> format.</p>
<p>The fMRI images are 4D images. These represent 3D image of the brain over a period of time (time is the fourth dimension). I want to convert these 4D images into a series of 3D images, where each 3D image would represent the brain at a particular time instant.</p>
<p>Is it possible to do this using Slicer? Please tell me the process.</p>
