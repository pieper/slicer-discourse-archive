<p>Hi, I know I can make the red window isolated and change it size for Screeenshot, but is there a way to decide the size based on quantity, like input the height and width size, just like Paraview.</p>
<p>I prefer no script, just use the GUI, or is there an easy way to use the script as I don’t know where to input the script,thanks!</p>
