<p>Hello, I am validating each of the first-order features with my calculations, and I have noticed that the <strong>Uniformity</strong> feature always gives me a value of 1. I have even used the ISBI computational model, and it also gives me a value of 1. Can you please help me identify my mistake?</p>
