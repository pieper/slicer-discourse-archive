<p>Hello everyone, I’m curious about the process of creating a panoramic X-ray image from a CT scan (My data from <a href="https://ditto.ing.unimore.it/toothfairy/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">this</a> dataset)?<br>
Furthermore, I’m interested in understanding how to transform a CT scan into the corresponding bitewing image accurately.</p>
