<p>Are any Slicer users/developers going to be at <a href="https://www.rsna.org/annual-meeting" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">RSNA</a> (Nov 26-30) this year and want to meet up?</p>
<p>I will be visiting from Australia and don’t get a chance to meet other Slicer users very often. I work in Nuclear Medicine and have been developing a module to analyze dynamic imaging studies.</p>

<p>Many years we’ve had a booth or training courses at RSNA but not this year.  There is going to be a <a href="https://www.rsna.org/annual-meeting/meeting-highlights/rsna-labs">lab session about the NCI Imaging Data Commons</a> that several Slicer developers participate in.  Also I know Kitware will have a booth, and Slicer is also going to be shown in some other booths.</p>
<p>If anyone else is interested we could also do some kind of birds of a feather meet up.</p>

<p>Indeed, we will have the IDC booth, and Slicer users are most welcomed to stop by!</p>
<p>I will be at the conference Sunday-Wednesday. I won’t be at the booth all the time, so if you would like to make sure I am there when you stop by, please PM!</p>
