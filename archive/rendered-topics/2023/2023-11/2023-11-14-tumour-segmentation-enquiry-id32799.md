<p>Hello<br>
I’m currently performing segmentation of MRI Images. Just enquiring if I can open two MRI sequences (DWI and ADC) at the same time and segment the tumour on both sequence side by side.</p>

<p>Yes, you can load multiple images and show them side-by-side or blended in one view. You can use both for segmentation.</p>
