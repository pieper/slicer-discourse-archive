<p>Operating system: Mac OS Sonoma<br>
Slicer version: 5.6<br>
Hey there thank you for this amazing extension, I know that the version of PyTorch that is currently used only supports CUDA compatible GPUs and for that reason everyone using a Apple Silicon GPU is out of luck, but I have read that there is a new version of PyTorch (PyTorch Nightly) that actually supports Mac gpus.<br>
So my Question is if it is possible for me to download this version of PyTorch for Totalsegmentor? Or if there is any plan to implement it in the future?<br>
Thank you for your Help or explaining to me if I did understand anything wrong.</p>
