<p>Hi<br>
I can’t see the SlicerVMTK extension.<br>
What to do?</p>

<p>You must install it from the ‘Extensions manager’ if you have not built Slicer yourself. It’s all within a GUI, no coding is required.</p>
<p>Otherwise, you must build any extension you want to use against your self-built tree.</p>
