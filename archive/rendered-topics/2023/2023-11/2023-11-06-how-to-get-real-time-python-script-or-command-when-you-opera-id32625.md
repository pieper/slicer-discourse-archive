<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I would like to discuss is it possible for 3D slicer to generate real-time python code when you do some operation in 3D slicer?<br>
I know we can give python codes to 3D slicer through python interactor. But as a beginner,  I would like to learn how to write it. For example, when I save my file, I hope I can see the corresponding code somewhere. Then I know, ‘ok! This is the command for save!’</p>
<p>I hope I make my question cleary, and very thankful for your discussion.</p>
<p>Best,<br>
Chuan</p>

<p>No, there’s no feature like that currently.</p>
<p>We point people to the <a href="https://slicer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer_guide/script_repository.html">Script Repository</a> for examples, and <a href="https://slicer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer_guide/python_faq.html#how-to-find-a-python-function-for-any-slicer-features">these instructions for finding the python code for GUI features</a>.</p>
<p>People also sometimes find ChatGPT and similar tools helpful to generate code.</p>
