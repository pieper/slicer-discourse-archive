<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I’ve build Slicer Jupyter extension and can successively use it within SlicerCAT application.</p>
<p>But now everytime I create jupyter notebook in VSCode it tries to detect exsiting Jupyter Kernels and suddenly runs my SlicerCAT <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>
<p>Finally it finds existing kernels and here I can see my SlicerCAT.</p>
<p>By the way the default python in VSCode is Slicer’s python.</p>
<p>Any suggestion how to keep SlicerCAT kernel and prohibit automatically launching it at the time when VSCode tries to detect kernels?</p>
<p>Windows 11</p>
