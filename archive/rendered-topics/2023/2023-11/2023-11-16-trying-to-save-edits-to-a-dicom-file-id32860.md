<p>Operating system: macOS<br>
Slicer version: 5.4.0</p>
<p>First time using Slicer, and I have uploaded and edited a DICOM file. I have made simple volume renderings to it and I am trying to save this to re-access it at a later date. How can I save to re-access and keep editing the DICOM file from where I left off?</p>
<p>Many thanks for the help.</p>

<p>You can just save the scene and reload it later.</p>
