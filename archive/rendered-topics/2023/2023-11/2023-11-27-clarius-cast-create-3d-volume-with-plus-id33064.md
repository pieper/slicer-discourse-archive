<p>Hello, we are using the Clarius C3HD3 and trying to create a 3D volume from live images taken by the probe. We are able to display live images via Plus. Can these live images be used directly to create a 3D volume in Slicer? Is there already an extension for this?<br>
In which file format should the image data be available in Slicer?</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>
