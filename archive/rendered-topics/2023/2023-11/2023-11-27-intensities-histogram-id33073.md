<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am trying to make a histogram of a segmentation with 3 segments to know the intensities. I want to divide the histogram values by the number of pixels within each segment. Currently the histogram amplitudes are a function of the segmentation volume size. Any idea how can I do it?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
