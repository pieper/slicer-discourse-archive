<p>Hey,</p>
<p>I have quantitative maps like (blood volume, rOEF) extracted from MR acquisitions, each quantitative map exist as 32 dicom files, when importing the folder to the Slicer, it recognizes the patient id and instance number of each dcm slice correctly. Is there a way to merge all the slices into one dcm or nrrd file?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance</p>
