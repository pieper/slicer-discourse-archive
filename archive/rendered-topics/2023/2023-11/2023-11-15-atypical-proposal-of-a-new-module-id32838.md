<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I’ve pushed this module, ‘<a href="https://gitlab.com/chir-set/Tools7/-/tree/master/CenterlineDisassembly" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Centerline disassembly</a>’, on my gitlab repository. It breaks down a centerline model into groups that can be identified by the VMTK libraries, namely bifurcations, branches and individual centerlines from the first endpoint to all others.</p>
<p>I’m willing to contribute this one more module to SlicerVMTK, if its maintainers deem it a valuable addition. If that’s not the case, end of story.</p>
<p>Otherwise, trouble just starts, since I cannot log in my gihub account to submit a pull request to SlicerVMTK. This is due to the new login policies of github, which were not in place when I created my account there, else I could never have been able to contribute to SlicerVMTK. Namely, I reject the new policy of mandatory 2FA for login and ‘other actions’ as they say.</p>
<p>One way would be: integrate the module locally in SlicerVMTK, send the patch to a maintainer who would merge it in online SlicerVMTK. It’s obviously very ugly and not sustainable. If there are smarter ways, please advise.</p>
<p>Thanks and regards.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>This is just a ping for visibility of a <a href="https://github.com/vmtk/SlicerExtension-VMTK/pull/104" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">PR</a> <em>proposing</em> 2 more modules.</p>
<p>Regards.</p>

<p>Will you still be on GitHub to help maintain these new modules in the future?</p>

<p>I resolved to get back on github only because I contributed some modules to SlicerVMTK in the past 3 years. So yes, I’ll help maintain my contributions in the future.</p>
