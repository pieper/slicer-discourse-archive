<p>When I added the structure (planar contour) of RT to the 3D slicer, and wanted to edit the body contour, 3D Slicer asked me to convert planar contour to binary label. I found that the resolution was lost too much. How can I improve the resolution of binary label? Reduce distortion of planar contour?<br>
Thanks</p>
