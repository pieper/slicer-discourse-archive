<p>Hey,</p>
<p>I would appreciate, if someone could tell me how I can save my 3D Reconstruction on my Mac, so that I can later open it again and edit/measure it again?<br>
Because I first want to reconstruct my bones structure of my 20 different patients from my study, and after I want to measure.<br>
Thanks a lot in advance.</p>

<p>You can save data or the entire scene by simply pressing Command+S.<br>
Have a look at the documentation for more details about the save dialog :</p>
