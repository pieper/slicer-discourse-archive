<p>Hello,<br>
I have ready labeled data and when I click on the Next Instance button in the MONAILabel extension I connected via 3D slicer, I get the message “Unlabeled samples or images not found at server. Instead please go to File → Add Data to load image.” I am getting the error. I can’t go back to a labeled image and edit it again without using the MONAILabel Reviewer extension? What can I do about this? Can’t I change the labeled data directly in the MONAILabel extension?<br>
The labels of my data are in label-&gt;final. The original file is empty inside.<br>
I would be very grateful if you can help me with this issue.</p>
