<p>I have an ultrasound cineloop loaded as a sequence with a sequence browser in slicer. I would like to allow the user to be able to scroll through the cineloop playback by using the mouse wheel when hovering over the slice which displays the image (not just while hovering over the sequence browser toolbar). Is this possible? I was not easily able to find any documentation about mouse wheel events.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
