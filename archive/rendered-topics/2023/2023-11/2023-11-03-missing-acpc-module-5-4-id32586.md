<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Does anyone know what happened to the ACPC transform module in 5.4? Can’t find it under specialized where it used to be. Also tried to install SlicerNeuro but it simply crashed slicer after restart.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Hmm, I just tried the SlicerNeuro extension on linux with a recent preview version and the ACPC module is there.  Maybe you can investigate why SlicerNeuro isn’t working for you.</p>
