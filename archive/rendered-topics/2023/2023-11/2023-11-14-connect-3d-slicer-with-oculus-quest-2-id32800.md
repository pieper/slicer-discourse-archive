<p>Hello, I have tried to connect the Oculus Quest 2 through the VR slicer and I have not been able to. If you could advise me on how to connect it to the 3D slicer, I would appreciate it.</p>

<p>I tried also, but without success.<br>
I’m not sure what is necessary.</p>
<p>Has anyone tried VirtualDesktop?</p>
