<p>Hello and thank you very much for your content and learned a lot. But I think I don’t have a good idea of where to start. I want to print a baby in 3D and a family member who is a doctor has the ultra sound equipment, his equipment is not very recent, but it accepts USB memory, what type of file is the one that I must extract from his equipment to manipulate it in the slicer. e practiced with downloaded examples of babies but I want to use it with this doctor</p>
