<p>I used to use model to model distance using version 2.0 and now I don’t see that on the newest version 5.2.2.  Can you tell me what module is now is called to measure model to model distance?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>The extension is available for download for Slicer-5.2.2 on all operating systems. Please try again and when you have found it let us know what made it difficult (you needed to switch to the install tab, you have entered the extension name with spaces, filtering was slow, …?). Thanks!</p>
