<p>Hello dear ones,</p>
<p>as part of my master’s thesis I am working on segmentation and modeling of vertebrae of the human spine. To avoid data protection barriers, I started to work with the sample datasets from 3D Slicer. While doing so, I asked myself if it would be legal to make the segmented and exported vertebrae models freely available on a publicly accessible homepage (such as Thingiverse)?<br>
I found an older forum entry (<a href="https://discourse.slicer.org/t/usage-rights-to-sample-data/17619" class="inline-onebox">Usage Rights to Sample Data</a>) about a different question, but its answer gives me reason to hope that publication would not be a problem.</p>
<p>Many thanks in advance for your help and best regards<br>
Felix</p>

<p>In general, sample data sets in Slicer are free to use without restrictions. You can find specific information about some data sets in the “Acknowledgement” section of the “Sample Data” module.</p>

<p>All right. There I found explicitly about the dataset used the information that it comes “with a permissive copyright-license, allowing for data to be shared, distributed and improved upon”. Thanks a lot for the help and the hint to look there!</p>
