<p>How can I generate Gauss and Mean Curvatures of the model?</p>
<p>Is there any extention in Slicer which I can do this?</p>

    Hello, 
I was hoping I could get some help/ideas on how I can get a measure of the curvature of the model (curvature of insect cornea to be exact). In my project, I am interested in quantifying the curvature of the cornea (i.e. how curved or flat the cornea is) across different species which can affect several properties of the vision (please see the attached image). The image depicted here is the surface cut (after placing the closed curve) from the whole insect head. Is there any way I can do …
