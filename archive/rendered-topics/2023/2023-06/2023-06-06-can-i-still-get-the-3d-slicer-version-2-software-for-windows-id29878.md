<p>I need 3D Slicer version 2 for one of my research experiments. Can I still download that specific version on my window computer? Thanks.</p>

<p>Why do you need Slicer version 2? You can access older releases from the <a href="https://download.slicer.org/">download page</a>, but it may not go back as far as Slicer2.</p>
<p>You can still find Slicer3 binaries <a href="https://www.slicer.org/slicer3-downloads/">here</a> (I’ve tried a few years ago and it still ran on Windows).</p>

<p>I while ago I went back and tested a bunch of old slicer2 versions and they all still ran on a recent version of windows.</p>
