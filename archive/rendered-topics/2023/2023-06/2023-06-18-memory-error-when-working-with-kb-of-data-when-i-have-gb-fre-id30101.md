<p>I have been trying to use the markups-&gt; cloze function feature to analyze a JPG that is only ~5 kb of size and I have ~32 GB of free memory on my computer. 3D slicer continually bottle necks my PC taking all 32 GB when I try and add the 3rd or 4th closed curve.  It sits at 99% memory usage until the application crashes. The CPU also climbs to 50% usage during the crash. I have tried to update my GPU and CPU as well as clear more GB of data from my PC. The exception thrown in event it gives is BAD ALLOCATION. I grew up very rural and I am horrid with computers. Do I just need more RAM? The file size is so small compared to the amount of free memory? If anyone has any suggestions, please help! Thanks!</p>

<p>What is the volume size in voxels?<br>
Do you convert it to grayscale?<br>
What do you mean by “markups-&gt; cloze function feature”?<br>
What kind of processing or analysis would you like to do with the image?</p>
