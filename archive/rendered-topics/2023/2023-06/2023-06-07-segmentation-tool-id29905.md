<p>Hello,<br>
When I set the thresholding upper and lower limits, there are highlights in the views. However, after I applied, nothing shows up and “show 3D” also didn’t work. Is there something wrong with the way I operate?</p>

<p>Make sure the masking settings allow modification of the current segment. See more information in the <a href="https://slicer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/modules/segmenteditor.html#cannot-edit-the-segments">Segment Editor module FAQ</a>.</p>
