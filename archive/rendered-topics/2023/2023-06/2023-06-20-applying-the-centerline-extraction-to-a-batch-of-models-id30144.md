<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am trying to perform centerline extraction and quantifiaction using the slicer <a href="https://github.com/vmtk/SlicerExtension-VMTK" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">VMTK extension</a>.<br>
Using the feature that auto-detects the end-points of the centerline, I want to perform the computation on a batch of surfaces contained in a folder automatically using python.<br>
Essentially, I want to be able to run the <a href="https://github.com/vmtk/SlicerExtension-VMTK/blob/master/ExtractCenterline/ExtractCenterline.py" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">following script</a> over a set of surfaces telling slicer that the end-points should be auto-detected.<br>
Any pointers on how to go about this?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance,</p>
