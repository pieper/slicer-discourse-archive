<p>Hi everyone. I am new on the 3D slicer community. I need your help to have some tips to realize a quantitative analysis of blood vessels from angiography sequence in MRI. I can made the segmentation of blood vessels and to determine the volume but i would like to have more informations like the tortuosity, diameter of different vessel or the density.<br>
Thanks in advance for your help<br>
Sincerely<br>
Amandine B</p>
