<p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>I am trying to export a sequence of markup points. Currently when I try to right click on the sequence it only exports the markup for the current scene. I believe that my solution will require me to use a python script to iterate over each data node, however, I am unsure how to access this markup sequence and iterate over it.</p>
<p>If anyone could help it would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
