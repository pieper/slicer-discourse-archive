<p>Hi I am new to Slicer and I have ten png images already registered, I want to turn them into a 3D object that allows me to view it in different angels, is it something that would be achieved by 3D slicer?</p>

    Hi, 
I have multiple single .ima files. These contain single slices info. 
What I want to achieve is to merge all these into one .nii file. 
What is the best way to do that? 
Thanks

    I have two stacks of .png images, imported as .tiff files, corresponding to axial and sagittal MRI data. Once I put them into Slicer using the “Data” panel, both stacks are only visible using the “Axial” view. I am trying to segment a 3D volume using the segmentation editor, but since the views are both marked as Axial, the paint tool for each volume is not aligned. I have tried using transforms to switch the plane of the Sagittal .tiff image stack, but it only flips the data in the axial view. …

I want to reconstruct 10 2D images to 3D. I have tried MatLab but I am having difficulties interpolating the gaps in between the adjacent slices. A colleague told me to try Slicer but I don’t know how to navigate the app. Here is the link to the slices:<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/1trxs9fy0btcbsa/AABJ_t-6-JLDXqtAPWU0jBQea?dl=0" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Dropbox - OCT_42_pix - Simplify your life</a>

    Im working on a project where i need to determine the volume of fibrosis in cochlea’s. the raw data consists of +/- 100 microscopic photo’s of the cut up cochlea that i aligned and stacked in order(.tiff file). I coloured the segments ( bone; internal space; fibrosis) and tried to use segment statistics to find the volumes of the different segments. when i did this however i got volumes in the thousands cm3. The size differences between the segments seem right but the scale is not.
