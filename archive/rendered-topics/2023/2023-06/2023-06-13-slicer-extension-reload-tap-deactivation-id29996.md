<p>Operating system: window 10<br>
Slicer version: 5.2.1</p>
<p>There is no problem in using the module I created as an ‘extension’ in my local.<br>
If I run the ‘extension module’ that works normally on my computer on another computer, ‘reload’ disappears. However, this is not the case on all computers, but only on some computers.</p>

<p>The Reload button is only shown if you are in developer mode (see application settings, developer tab).</p>

<p>Problem solved. thank you</p>
<p>But I’m curious about one thing. Always applied reload to run ‘extension module’. Is there any other way to run the extension module?</p>
