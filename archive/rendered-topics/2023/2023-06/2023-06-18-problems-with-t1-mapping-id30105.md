<p>Hi<br>
I would like to ask you about the T1 mapping acquisition, using 3 separate series (3D LAVA) with different flip angles, but the T1 mapping module only recognizes “MultiVolume”. How can I “make” MultiVolume from my separate series?</p>
<p>Also, please let me know if there are other reasons why T1 mapping cannot be calculated.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
