<p>Dear all,<br>
is here someone i can talk to, who can help me with the start of uploading my data (.npy) in pyradiomics and extract features? the data is pre segmented CT images, which need to be loaded in python and i want to extract all features.<br>
i would need some help, since i only used R before.</p>
<p>i am kindly asking for someone who would offer some time and help me out; kind of a “teaching lesson”, i can offer remuneration and i would be so happy…</p>
<p>let me know,<br>
best<br>
Silke</p>
