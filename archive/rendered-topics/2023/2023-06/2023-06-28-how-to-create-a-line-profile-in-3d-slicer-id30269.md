<p>Hello,<br>
I am new in 3D slicer and I could not find out how I can create a line profile? I already used a ruler to create a line but it does not show a line profile.</p>
<p>I am thankful for your help!</p>
<p>With kind regards,<br>
Mahrukh</p>

<p>You can get intensity profile along a line using <code>Line Profile</code> module in <code>Sandbox</code> extension.</p>

<p>Where can I find the „Sandbox“ extension? Because if I click on „Extensions“ there’s no „sandbox“ <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/thinking.png?v=12" title=":thinking:" class="emoji" alt=":thinking:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>

<p>Please check again. It is between SPHARM-PDM and and ScatteredTransform extensions in the list. You can also type <code>sandbox</code> in the search box to find it.</p>
<p>If you still cannot find it then let us know what Slicer version and operating system you use.</p>

    Is there a way to use SandBox Intensity profile in Slicer 5 ? 
Or is it possible to place an Annotation Ruler in Slicer 5 ?
