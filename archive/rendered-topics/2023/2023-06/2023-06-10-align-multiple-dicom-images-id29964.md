<p>Hi there! I have been using slicer to import multiple DICOM files to compare the shapes of bones across multiple patients. I have been trying to see if Slicer aligns all DICOM images so that they are all in the same direction for statical shape analysis or if I have to manually align them? thanks!</p>
