<p>Hello, I have been working on a project that uses Slicer to help rasterize an .stl file to a TIFF stack of images. This process is aided by a very similar python script like <a href="https://slicer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer_guide/script_repository.html#rasterize-a-model-and-save-it-to-a-series-of-image-files" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">this</a> in the documentation. Recently I reinstalled Slicer and now I am getting an error stating: <strong>ModuleNotFoundError: No module named ‘imageio’</strong></p>
<p>I have Slicer also installed on another machine, and within the Lib\site-packages there is an imageio file within the directory, while on my machine (the one I am having issues with) there is no imageio in the directory.</p>
<p>I have also tried to use Slicer’s python console using <em>import imageio</em>, but I get the same exception.</p>
<p>Has Slicer dropped the use of imageio with the use of python? If not is there a way to fix this error?</p>

<p>From my memory, <code>imageio</code> has never been included in Slicer core. It was likely installed in Slicer whenever you installed an extension. Something like <code>scikit-image</code> uses that python package as a dependency.</p>
<p>To install additional python packages in a Slicer version, see the following documentation:</p>

<p>Hey James, I actually fixed this shortly after I posted this. Along the lines of development, I think I ran <em>pip_install(‘imageio’)</em> at some point and forgot like a goofball. That link you sent is essentially the solution I came to. Thank you for your help!</p>
