<p>That feature would be cool, so we don’t have to use another 3D modeling software <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>

    A new tool added to Segment Editor for drawing text on segments. Both engrave and emboss modes are available. Text can be placed by defining a plane using 3 points, and then position can be adjusted in 3D, along with text size and depth.
