<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have encountered a problem while trying to Crop a transmitted image stream from a Video Capture Card to Slicer. The stream is working fine but in 3dSlicer the images stay unchanged. I’ve already tried the ClipRectangle-method but unfortunately, that didn’t work for me. Below I’ll write the original ConfigFile I used for streaming. Please let me know if you can help out. Thanks in advance!</p>
 
  
    
    
      FrameSize="640 480"
      ClipRectangleOrigin="0 0"
      ClipRectangleSize=''320 240''&gt;
