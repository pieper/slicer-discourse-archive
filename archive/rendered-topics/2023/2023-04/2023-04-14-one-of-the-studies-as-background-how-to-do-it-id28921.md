<p>Problem:<br>
I have two exams of the same patient, CT, same equipment, same parameters. I want to see study 1 as foreground and background study 2, how to do it?<br>
When I import both studies, no matter how I set the order, I always see only one study. When viewed separately, they display correctly.<br>
Where am I making a mistake?</p>
