<p>Sorry, I have a question?<br>
What’s the shift scale image filter in 3dslicer?<br>
Is that (mu +/- 3sigma)?<br>
If yes, what numbers should be put in shift and scale values to make the above formula?<br>
And what’s shift and scale in this module?<br>
I want to normalize CT images before radiomics features extraction.<br>
Thanks a lot.</p>
