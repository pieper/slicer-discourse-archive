<p>Hello<br>
I have a question. I read code in <a href="https://github.com/Slicer/Slicer/blob/main/Modules/Loadable/Segmentations/EditorEffects/qSlicerSegmentEditorScissorsEffect.cxx" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">qSlicerSegmentEditorScissorsEffect.cxx</a> so. What is the idea of it?<br>
Thanks.</p>

<p>The scissors effect allows deleting (or filling) a region intuitively by marking it with the mouse in a 2D or 3D view.</p>

<p>See the Slicer user manual for some information: <a href="https://slicer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/modules/segmenteditor.html#scissors" class="inline-onebox">Segment editor — 3D Slicer documentation</a></p>
<p>There are also many tutorials on YouTube.</p>
