<p>Would this extension be able to capture deformities such as heterotopic ossification?</p>

<p>I doubt it will because it is not trained for that purpose and would not identify the ossifications as heterotopic. You could easily try this on one of your datasets.</p>

<p>TotalSegmentator is very robust, and trained on quite diverse anatomy, so it might be able to deal with such deformities. Please try and report back how well it works!</p>
