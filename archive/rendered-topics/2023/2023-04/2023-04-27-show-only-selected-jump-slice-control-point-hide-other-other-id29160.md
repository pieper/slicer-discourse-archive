<p>I have a range of implanted stereo EEG electrode contacts in my mark up file and am using the ‘jump slice’ function in Markups/Control Points to view selected electrode/contacts in the three axis. However when I ‘jump slice’ to view any given electrode/contact, the axial/coronal/sagittal slices are still crowded with the many other electrodes/contacts in the brain, which are proximal to the electrode of interest.</p>
<p>I want to be able to ‘jump slice’ to view a given electrode/contact point of interest in a way that hides all the other contact points, so that the electrode/contact of interest is more easily and clearly seen.</p>
<p>Does Slicer have this functionality?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>
