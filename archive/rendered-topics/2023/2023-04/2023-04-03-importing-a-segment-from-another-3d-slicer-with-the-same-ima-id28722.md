<p>Hi, I accidentally saved a file that I had overwritten its original segment. I have the original file and the file in which I made my segment. Is it possible to merge the two by importing the segmentation from the original file to my file? if it’s possible how should I do it?</p>

<p>You can copy/move segments in Segmentations module, or you can drag-and-drop segments in Data module (in the Subject hierarchy tree).</p>
