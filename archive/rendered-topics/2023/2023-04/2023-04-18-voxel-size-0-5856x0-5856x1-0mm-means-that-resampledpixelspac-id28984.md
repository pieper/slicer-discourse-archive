<p>Hi All, Would appreciate quick feedback on this: if the voxel size that can be seen in the VOLUMES module is 0.5856x0.5856x1.0mm, does that mean that the PARAMS file for Slicer Radiomics should be set to resampledPixelSpacing: [0.5856, 0.5856, 0.5856] in order to preserve the original resolution?<br>
Cheers, Marko</p>
