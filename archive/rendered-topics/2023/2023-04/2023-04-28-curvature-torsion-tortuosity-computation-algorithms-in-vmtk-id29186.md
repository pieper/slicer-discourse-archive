<p>Hello!</p>
<p>I am trying to calculate the geometric indices such as curvature, torsion and tortuosity from the extracted centrelines in 3D slicer by using VMTK extension. Can anyone please tell me what are the mathematical definitions used over here for calculations?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>You can find it in Luca Antiga’s <a href="https://lantiga.github.io/media/AntigaPhDThesis.pdf">PhD thesis</a> and/or papers. If the definitions are not clear enough then you can always take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/vmtk/vmtk">source code</a>.</p>
