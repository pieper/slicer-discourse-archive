<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I’m looking for the above mentioned data but just can’t seem to find anything useful/freely available online. Since I would mostly need the contour of the body, both CT and MR would do.<br>
The main focus would be the abdominal part.</p>
<p>Something similar like the “Public Mouse Image Database”<br>

<p>Does anyone happen to know anything that’s available for download? Maybe even has something like what I am looking for? <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>
<p>Thanks a lot!<br>
Attila</p>

<p>It really is, but unfortunately most of the interesting stuff is sort of under “use by permission” category (you have to request access).</p>

<p>Yep, I already have made  a few requests. I hope I’ll get permission. I guess it depends on the owners of the data. We’ll see <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>

<p>Try <a href="https://www.embodi3d.com/files/" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Downloads - embodi3D.com</a></p>
<p>There should be a lot of stl and dicom files, i think that i saw rat somewhere</p>

<p>(sorry for the late replay - I’ve been away for a few days <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"> )</p>
<p>So yes, I know that page. Never really looked at the contents in more detail, but I did find a “Veterinary scans” subsection in the downloads.<br>
It seems to be a bit messy, but we’ll see if there is anything that we could use.</p>
<p>Many thanks for the pointer!</p>

For the record, here are the bones for the rat hindlimb sections, showing which part of the body is included. I was hoping for lower limb as well.</p>
