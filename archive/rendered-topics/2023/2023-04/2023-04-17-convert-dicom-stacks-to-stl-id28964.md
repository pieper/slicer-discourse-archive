<p>Operating system: Windows 10<br>
Slicer version:5.2.1<br>
Expected behavior: display DICOM stack as solid model<br>
Actual behavior: screens remain blank</p>
<p>There are instructions which if followed should allow DICOM stacks to be converted to STL (etc) volumes and I gather they worked on some previous editions of Slicer. But  nothing happens if they are followed. Please help!</p>

<p>You can segment the structures of interest and export the results as STL. See detailed information, links to up-to-date tutorials, etc. in the <a href="https://slicer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/image_segmentation.html">Slicer documentation</a>.</p>
