<p>The answer mainly depends on what would you like to register - liver, spine, kidneys, intestines,…? What is the clinical procedure? What is the desired accuracy? Is it during pre-procedural planning or intra-procedural guidance (e.g., MRI to CBCT registration)?</p>

<p>Dear sir:<br>
Thanks for getting back to me.<br>
Here are some informations about my question.Firstly,the registration is about liver and bile ducts. Secondly all patients have performed PTCD(percuteneous transhepatic cholangio drainage). Last but not at least this study hopes to register as accurately as possible.<br>
I look forward to hearing from you soon.<br>
Sincerely<br>
Xiao Yong</p>
