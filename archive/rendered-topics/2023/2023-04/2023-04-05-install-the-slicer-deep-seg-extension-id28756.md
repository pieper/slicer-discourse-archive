<p>Hello!</p>
<p>Slicer version : 5.2.1</p>
<p>I’m trying to download the Slicer-DeepSeg extension via the 3D Slicer Extension  Manager. However, I can’t find the Slicer-Deepseg in the manager.</p>
<p>How can I manually install or find a way to find the 3D deep slicer in the extension?</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

<p>Hello <a class="mention" href="/u/curtis_sohn">@curtis_sohn</a>,</p>
<p>Thanks for your interest in the Slicer-DeepSeg extension.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the extension hasn’t been added to the 3D Slicer Extension Manager yet. However, it can be manually installed in the developer mode according to <a href="https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/4.10/Training#Developing_and_contributing_extensions_for_3D_Slicer" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">the following instructions</a>. Please follow the first 10 slides, but choose <strong>Select Extension</strong> instead of <strong>Create Extension</strong> as ilustrated in the tutorial.</p>
<p>Source code and installation instructions are available <a href="https://github.com/razeineldin/Slicer-DeepSeg" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">here</a></p>
<p>Best,<br>
Ramy</p>
