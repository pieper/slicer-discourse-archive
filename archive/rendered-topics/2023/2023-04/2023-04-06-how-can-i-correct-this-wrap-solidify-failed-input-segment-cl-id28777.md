<p>Make sure the selected input segment is not empty. Also check if the segment shows up correctly in 3D.</p>

<p>Thank you so much for your help . I would also like to ask if this is connected with ‘Toggle volume Rendering’ .I was able to segment the heart and The Pulmonary vessels from the CT scans together with  the lungs  when I used Aİ lung masks  but now I only see a 3d reconstruction of the lungs  and the Airways only not the heart and vessels when I click the Toggle Volume Rendering  button giving the Wrap solidify failed warning</p>
