<p>s there a tool to get the fat volume and separate it from the muscle volume? I have seen most of questions in the forum does not specify one tool. For example in my project I am planning to segment rotator cuff muscles and determine the fat volume and muscle volume separately by CT scan. Then want to export the volume to excel sheet.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

<p>Jakob Wasserthal from the TotalSegmentator team is working on integrating fat and rotator cuff muscle segmentation in his tool. As soon as it becomes available and is not commercially licensed we will integrate it into the TotalSegmentator 3D Slicer extension. Maybe you can place an issue or comment on the <a href="https://github.com/wasserth/TotalSegmentator">TotalSegmentator Github</a>.</p>
