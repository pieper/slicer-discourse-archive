<p>Hello colleagues! I am a new user of 3d slicer.</p>
<p>I segment vertebrae, discs, dural sac on axial and sagittal MRI scans of the lumbar spine. After the image is oriented in accordance with the anatomical axes, the ability to segment images is lost. I press the button «slice view controls» → «axial or sagittal» → «rotate to volume plane» and segmentation, using paint, the bulb of paint disappears.<br>
What can be done so that the segmentation does not disappear after the study is oriented along the anatomical axes?<br>
Thanks for the help</p>
