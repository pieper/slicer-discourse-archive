<p>Operating system: Windows 10<br>
Slicer version: 5.0.3<br>
Expected behavior:<br>
Actual behavior:</p>
<p>I want to assess the bone to muscle ratio, both in terms of volume and mass, from whole body µCT scan images. Can anybody suggest me a good comprehensive protocol to such quantification studies in 3D slicer?<br>
Thank you.</p>
