<p>All actual files are deleted when files are deleted from the DICOM database.</p>

<p>I can’t replicate this.  Tested on 5.2.2 on windows 11 by importing files and then deleting them from the database and the original files were unchanged.  If you find a situation where the files are deleted please give more details on how to replicate.</p>
