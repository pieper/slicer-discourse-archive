<p>Greetings Slicers,</p>
<p>Is it possible to make a PRM (parametric response mapping) from an inspiratory and expiratory chest CT scan with 3DSlicer?<br>
I know, that i need an image registration between inspiratory and expiratory scans. To make that, I downloaded the Elastix extension to my 3DSlicer. After that, i should create the PRM, but i don’t know, how. Which extension i could use?</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>
