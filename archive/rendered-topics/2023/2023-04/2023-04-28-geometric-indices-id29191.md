<p>Hi!</p>
<p>Can anyone help me with the active scalars that are available for calculation in the centreline model? For the first model, I tried, all parameters were visible (torsion, tortuosity, length and radius) but afterwards only radius was there. I am new to 3D Slicer and VMTK, can anyone tell what I am missing out.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>
