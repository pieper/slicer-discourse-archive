<p>I have a compressed DICOM file (DICOMDIR) that I am trying to load into 3D Slicer and produce a 3D volume of a patient’s head. I have tried uploading the data into 3D Slicer, but I receive an error saying that the files are unable to be uploaded. When I click ‘show details’, it only says that the load has failed :(.</p>

<p>I would be grateful if someone could propose a way to solve this issue!</p>

<p>Please use the DICOM module (File-&gt;Add DiCOM Data) to import dicom files into Slicer.</p>

<p>So I have managed to upload some DICOM files, but they are all as separate slices and I would like to visualise all the slices as one volume. How could i do this?</p>
