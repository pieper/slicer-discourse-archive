<p>Hi,<br>
I’m a new user of 3Dslicer Mac version 5.2.1.</p>
<p>I’m currently working on paralumbar muscles in MRI, particularly their volumes and fatty degeneration:</p>
<ol>
<li>Once the volume of a muscle is achieved, is it possible to perform a local threshold on the total volume? In order to separate the muscle (black) from the fat (white) into only two distinct elements (ie. binary solution only black or white).</li>
<li>Once the volume of a muscle is achieved, is it possible to perform a local threshold on a ROI within the volume, for a given slice?</li>
<li>More generally, is it possible to perform a local threshold on a predefined area (e.g. on a CSA of the muscle), and not on the whole axial slice section?</li>
</ol>
<p>Thanks</p>
