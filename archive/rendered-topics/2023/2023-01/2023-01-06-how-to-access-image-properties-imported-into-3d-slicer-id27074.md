<p>Operating system: window 11<br>
Slicer version: 4.13.0</p>
<p>Hi all ,</p>
<p>Actually This’s my final question for first project.</p>
<p>If you import mesh data (.ply file) into 3d slicer, it will be rendered within RAS coordinates.<br>
I want to access the vtkpoly file for the mesh data rendered within the RAS coordinates of this 3D slicer. What should I refer to the function name for?</p>
<p>‘within RAS coordinate’ meaning :</p>
<p>As I understand it, all mesh data (.ply files) use the same world coordinate system, but their relative positions are not the same.</p>
<p>So, I understood that 3D sclier approximates and renders mesh data within the RAS coordinate system.</p>
<p>I would like to access the mesh data properties after this process.</p>
<p>What should I refer to?</p>
