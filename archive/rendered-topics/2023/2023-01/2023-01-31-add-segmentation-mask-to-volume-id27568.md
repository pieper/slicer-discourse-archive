<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have created a segmentation as a numpy array. What is the procedure to add the segmentation to the original volume and then display it in Slicer. I’ve seen someone else use the function “slicer.util.arrayFromSegmentBinaryLabelmap”, but I am unsure on how to use it.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

<p>You can find an example using the function here:<br>
