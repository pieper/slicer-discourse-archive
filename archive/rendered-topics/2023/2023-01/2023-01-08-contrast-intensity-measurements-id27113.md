<p>Dear All, I am new in 3D slicer. My Mac died and I cannot use now the Osirix. I need to measure the contrast intensities in my phantom which is build of 12 tubes with different concentrations of contrast agent. Can I do it with 3D slicer?</p>

<p>Yes, this should be quite easy.  You should be able to use the Threshold and Islands tools in the Segment Editor and then the Segment Statistics.  Let us know if you have trouble.</p>
