<p>As we’ve done as part of the previous two times we are going to hold a 2-hour workshop on the use of MONAI Label in 3D Slicer the week before Project Week. This will include updates from several people in the NA-MIC community who have been using it in their work and a chance to do hands-on experiments to help you get ready for Project Week activities.</p>
<p>The workshop will be Wednesday, January 25, 2023 (9-11am EST)</p>
<p>More information here including a link to the registration form: <a href="https://projectweek.na-mic.org/PW38_2023_GranCanaria/MONAILabel_Workshop.html" class="inline-onebox">MONAI Label Workshop / Tutorial | NA-MIC Project Weeks</a></p>
<p>In addition, for developers and people who want a deeper dive into MONAI in general, Nvidia is holding two longer MONAI Bootcamp sessions on the 25 and 26 starting just after our MONAI Label workshop: <a href="https://events.nvidia.com/janmonaibootcamp" class="inline-onebox">MONAI Bootcamp</a></p>

<p>I think these two events would be a great place to start.  You might want to also watch the videos from the previous workshops (linked from the workshop info page).  There are also a lot of videos and other online material linked from the <a href="https://monai.io/started.html">MONAI pages</a>.</p>

<p>Just a reminder - yesterday was the official deadline but if you register today for the workshop that will be held Wednesday, January 25, 2023 (9-11am EST) there is still room for a few more people (96 have registered so far and we should be able to handle at least 110).</p>

<p>Thank you that is great, Im based in Australia so i cant be a part of it live. Is there a recording available?<br>
Also, I wanted to ask, I have Slicer 5.2.1 and I cannot connect to the MONAI server easily. Is there a way I can solve this problem?</p>

<p>We have made a <a href="https://projectweek.na-mic.org/PW37_2022_Virtual/Projects/MONAILabelLung/MONAILabel_Installation.html">MONAILabel installation document</a> for the last Project Week, which was recently tested and still works. If you have further problems, please add a separate question in the Slicer discourse.  And yes, a recording is planned.</p>

<p>Hi <a class="mention" href="/u/pieper">@pieper</a>, I am registered, but zoom is asking me for a passcode to attend the meeting.<br>
Maybe I am missing something?</p>
<p>EDIT: Solved via discord, thanks!</p>
