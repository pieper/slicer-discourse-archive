<p>Hi,<br>
I found python code of segmenteditorextraeffects on github and was wondering if the code can be used stand alone ( by integrtating it in another code )  or it only can be used in python command in the software itself.<br>
I understand that there must be an interacton between the user and the software and therefore an interface is inevitable, I, however, wish to use some of the tools and integrate them in a code as a function where I’m concerned by the inputs and outputs</p>
