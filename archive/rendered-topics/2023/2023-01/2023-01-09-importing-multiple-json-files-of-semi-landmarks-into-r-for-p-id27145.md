<p>I have looked through the tutorial available on Github (<a href="https://github.com/SlicerMorph/Tutorials/blob/main/GPA_3/parser_and_sample_R_analysis.md" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Tutorials/parser_and_sample_R_analysis.md at main · SlicerMorph/Tutorials · GitHub</a>) but am still having trouble with importing my files containing semi-landmarks into R.<br>
I’m looking for a way to import multiple files as a folder (like you can do through GPA in SlicerMorph) and then create a PCA comparing the data from each file.</p>
<p>Does anyone have any advice or have done this before?<br>
Thank you</p>
