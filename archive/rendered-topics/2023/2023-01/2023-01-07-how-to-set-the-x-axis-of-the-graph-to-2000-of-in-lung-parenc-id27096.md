<p>Thank you for always your help.<br>
I would like to set the x-axis of the graph to -2000 of in lung parenchyma analysis as the report<br>

I performed  parenchyma analysis by Slicer version:5.2.1.<br>
The minimum x-axis was -1000.<br>
Could you  please tell me how to set up  minimum x-axis  to-2000 ?<br>
Operating system:<br>
Slicer version:<br>
Expected behavior:<br>
Actual behavior:</p>
