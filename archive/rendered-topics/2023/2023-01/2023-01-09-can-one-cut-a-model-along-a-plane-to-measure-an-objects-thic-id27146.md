<p>Operating system:Windows 10<br>
Slicer version: 5.2.1<br>
Expected behavior:<br>
Actual behavior:</p>
<p>I need to measure thicknesses of (iliac) bones from obj or STL. I am trying measure them by placing cross and dot glyphs on each surface and measuring between them. To test the method, I am measuring some scans of bones for which I have casts which I measure using calipers. But I don’t seem to get acceptably close measurements.</p>
<p>Is it possible to use the Plane capability to cut/slice through the obj/stl, rotate it and measure the width across the virtual cut?.</p>
<p>Many thanks</p>
