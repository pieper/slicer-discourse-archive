<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I need to segment a bone fragments from a fracture with external fixateur and do a 3D-reconstruction of the small segments. Due to metal artifacts from the fixateur, selecting all the small segments is difficult. Is there some filter that I could apply for reduction of the metal artifacts?</p>

<p>Dear Nora,</p>
<p>I’m unware of any such filters within slicer (there may well be!),<br>
but you could have a look at the nice work of Dr Graham Treece/Cambridge that could help here:</p><aside class="onebox allowlistedgeneric" data-onebox-src="https://mi.eng.cam.ac.uk/Main/GMT_wxDicom">
