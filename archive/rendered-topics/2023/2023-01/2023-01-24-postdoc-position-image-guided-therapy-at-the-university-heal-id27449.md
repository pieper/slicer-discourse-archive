<p><strong>Postdoc Position Image-Guided Therapy in Toronto, Canada</strong></p>
<p>Over the years, our team at University Health Network (UHN), University of Toronto, led by Sangeet Ghai, has developed methods for MR-guided laser thermal therapy for localized prostate cancer. We propose treatment planning software that optimizes the ablation protocol for individual patients providing precise targeting of the tumor volume and improved preservation of surrounding healthy tissues. For future clinical trials, this requires a new tool to plan the placement of fiberoptics within the target tissue, ensuring an optimal heating pattern. Topics of the postdoc’s research and daily work include:</p>
<p>•	Implementation of software for generating optimal needle placement patterns, which must be adjustable by the clinician to account for interventional constraints<br>
•	Selecting suitable laser power parameters and modelling of the resulting regions of cell death<br>
•	Analysis of needle deflection data to identify an approach for deflection compensation or mitigation<br>
•	Detection and compensation for patient motion during the procedure<br>
•	Extending MR thermography software to provide robust, accurate, and reliable treatment monitoring<br>
•	Analyse the potential in reduction in treatment times<br>
•	Segmentation of anatomical structures and data analysis<br>
•	Experience in MRI would be advantageous<br>
•	Shadowing clinical procedures<br>
•	Writing manuscripts</p>
<p>To achieve this, we are offering a 2-year contract for a post-doctoral fellow with a strong background in programming, e.g. computer science or biomedical engineering. The position is co-funded by MITACS and Siemens Healthineers. Part of the work will be conducted together with the industrial partner. An annual salary of CAD 70,000 is foreseen. Anticipated start date is March to May 2023 (depending on requirements).</p>
<p>The goal is a Slicer-based system for prostate laser interstitial thermal therapy. The system has hardware components (real-time MR thermometry, positioning hardware) and should allow semi-automatic planning.</p>
<p>We expect the following (demonstrated competency, e.g. through your Github repo, publications, and previous supervisor’s reference letter):<br>
•	Strong programming skills (C++, Python)<br>
•	Experience with Slicer, CMake, VTK,<br>
•	Creating own Slicer extensions like SlicerIGT or custom-build Slicer applications<br>
•	Knowledge about imaging modalities, LITT procedures<br>
•	Interdisciplinary work experience in the biomedical/clinical domain<br>
•	Ability to write manuscripts and publish<br>
•	No more than 5-years post PhD</p>
<p>We are looking forward to learning more about you and your previous work! Please send your application by 15th February 2023 to Kateri.corr@uhn.ca with the subject “MITACS Postdoc Slicer LITT.”</p>
