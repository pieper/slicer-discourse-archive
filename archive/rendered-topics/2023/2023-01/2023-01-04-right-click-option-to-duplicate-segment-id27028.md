<p>Dear 3D Slicer developers,<br>
the question of how to duplicate segments has been asked here several times already. I saw that there is even a script (<a href="https://slicer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer_guide/script_repository.html#clone-a-segment" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://slicer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer_guide/script_repository.html#clone-a-segment</a>) that I just tested and it works perfectly as it should to do the job.<br>
Is it possible to put this functionality as a right-click option into the segment editor module, so that it is easily accessible to novice users? I am aware that the same can be achieved through the subject hierarchy view in the data module (which now actually works as expected) and by using a workaround with the logical operations but, from my feeling, having this as a right-click option would be where new users would look for it, plus, one does not have to leave the segment editor module for this task.<br>
Best wishes,<br>
Mario</p>
