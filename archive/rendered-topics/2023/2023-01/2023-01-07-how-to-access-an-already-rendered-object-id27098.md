<p>Operating system: window 11<br>
Slicer version: 4.13.0</p>
<p>Hi, all</p>
<p>Which function should be referenced to access the object in the image rendered on the 3D sclier?</p>
<p>I’m planning a Python extension module, and I want to know the internal function to access information about a specific object (.ply) that has already been rendered on the 3D slicer.</p>
