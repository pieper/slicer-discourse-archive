<p>Dear Team</p>
<p>After segmentation, I click “Show 3D” and nothing happens, I can not see the model, the window is empty. Tried many times, did not work. Is there any solution to this problem?</p>

<p>Maybe you need to re-center the scene? Below you have the TinyPatient dataset after clicking the Show3D button and an indication to where the center scene click button is.</p>

<p>If you still can’t see anything, you could give it a try to the TinyPatient dataset (you can download it from the Welcome module), and give us a hint on whether that worked.</p>

<p>Thank you very much for your reply! The problem was that 3d model appeared far above the quadrangle with sides, so I had to zoom it out and then was able to find</p>
