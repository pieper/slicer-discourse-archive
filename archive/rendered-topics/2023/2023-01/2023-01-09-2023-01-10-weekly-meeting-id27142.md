<p>Tomorrow, we will be having our next weekly hangout at <strong>11:00 AM ET until 12:00PM ET</strong>.  The time slot has been shifted due to the <a href="https://discourse.slicer.org/t/na-mic-project-week-reminder-next-project-week-prep-meeting-tomorrow-tuesday-jan-10th/27141">Project Week preparation calls</a>.</p>
<p>We will likely be re-using the <a href="https://etsmtl.zoom.us/j/86211702920?pwd=TEl0ZTFDam90WVN5bjZhR05kNVRVZz09">Project Week zoom call link</a> as we have done previously.</p>

<p>Agenda:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://slicer.cdash.org/index.php?project=SlicerPreview#!#Extensions-Nightly" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Extension dashboard status</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Please post to this thread to put a topic on the agenda!  We will try to prioritize agenda items during the meeting.</p>
<p>Thanks<br>
Sam and J-Christophe</p>

<p>In the meeting today we (<a class="mention" href="/u/pieper">@pieper</a>, <a class="mention" href="/u/lassoan">@lassoan</a>, <a class="mention" href="/u/mau_igna_06">@mau_igna_06</a>, <a class="mention" href="/u/sam_horvath">@Sam_Horvath</a>, <a class="mention" href="/u/connor-bowley">@Connor-Bowley</a>, <a class="mention" href="/u/rafaelpalomar">@RafaelPalomar</a>)  were discussing about some of the extensions tests failing due to missing dependencies during testing (<a href="https://github.com/Slicer/Slicer/issues/6529" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://github.com/Slicer/Slicer/issues/6529</a>)</p>
<p>One interesting idea that came up in the discussion was to do individual extension testing in separate containers where the dependencies are pulled-in (and possibly installed in the testing container); apparently dependencies in some extensions might alter the Slicer environment making other extensions not compatible. Along with this idea, there was a discussion on whether we could create/support infrastructure to allow developers to do the testing on their own with github actions or similar. This would effectively make the testing distributed, reduding the testing burden for the Slicer project.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/jcfr">@jcfr</a>, as we have discussed the extensions testing before, it would be nice to know your thoughts on these ideas.</p>
