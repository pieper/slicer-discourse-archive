<p>TotalSegmentor is available after installing the associated Slicer extension. Make sure you have the extension installed.</p>

<p>Hello James</p>
<p>Thank you so much for the support. The module is working fine now. Is there anything similar we can use for head and neck region.</p>
<p>Best Regards<br>
