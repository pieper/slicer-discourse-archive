<p>The quality dashboard system (CDash) will be temporarily unavailable while system updates are performed.</p>
<p>The CDash instances will be unavailable during most of this time. The total upgrade is expected to take between 1-3 hours.</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>These means that configure/build/test results correspondings to <code>SlicerPreview</code> and <code>SlicerStable</code> scheduled builds will likely not all be available.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You should expect <strong>application and extension packages to be uploaded and available</strong> through <code>download.slicer.org</code> and <code>extensions.slicer.org</code> (aka Extensions manager)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This also applies to the more general instances known as <code>open.cdash.org</code> and <code>trunk.cdash.org</code></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have any questions, please reach out.</p>

<p>The update was completed earlier today.</p>
<p>The CDash reports for <code>2023-01-27</code> associated with both the <a href="https://slicer.cdash.org/index.php?project=SlicerStable&amp;date=2023-01-27">SlicerStable</a> or <a href="https://slicer.cdash.org/index.php?project=SlicerPreview&amp;date=2023-01-27">SlicerPreview</a> dashboards seem to all have been processed.</p>
<p>Let us know if you observe any issues.</p>
