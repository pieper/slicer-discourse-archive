<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have a question regarding pyradiomics usage/configuration in Slicer.<br>
I performed manual segmentation of a structure in a CT exam with Slicer et tried extracting shape features with both Slicer Radiomics and pure pyradiomics.<br>
Everything works fine with Slicer Radiomics and output is correctly generated. But the features extraction fails with pure pyradiomics with segmentation fault. Are there specific changes to pyradiomics usage in Slicer that I might reproduce in pyradiomics to make it work ? Or if you have any insight to where the issue might come from (lib version ? configuration ? segmentation mask) ?</p>
<p>Thank you for your help!</p>
