<p>Hello<br>
I want to run pyradiomics on my MRI data with 3D slicer, Considering that my data was prepared with different devices (1.5 and 3 Tesla) and the resolution of the images is also different.</p>
<ol>
<li>Are the features extracted from this package calculated relatively? (For fixing the resolution difference problem)</li>
<li>And does the use of MRI devices with different field strength create a problem?</li>
</ol>
<p>Thanks</p>
