<p>I want to fit a cylinder in the superior facies of the trochlea tali of the talus, to finally arrive at a local coordinate system. Is there a direct way for this? I can find how to do this with a sphere, but not with a cylinder.<br>
This can be done in mimics, but I would like to do this in 3d slicer</p>
