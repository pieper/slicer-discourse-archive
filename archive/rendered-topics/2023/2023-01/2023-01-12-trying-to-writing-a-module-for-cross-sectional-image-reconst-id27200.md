<p>Hi , First I want to thank you all for your wonderful app and incredible support ,<br>
I a new to 3Dslicer and  I wrote a python code for generating cross-sectional images . I am trying to  build a module in 3Dslicer that gives 360 projection  images as an input and after using the code renders the final 3D volume.<br>
where should I start to do so ?</p>

  <p>RTK is an open-source, cross-platform system that provides developers with an extensive suite of software tools for image analysis.   </p>
