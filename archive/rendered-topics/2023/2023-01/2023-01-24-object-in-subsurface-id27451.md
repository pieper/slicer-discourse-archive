<p>Hello, i want help if anyone knows</p>
<p>i’m looking a barried object (metal box) and i get some data from my gpr. i use raw image in the 3d slicer but i cant figure how can i see some structure in the image, is any other way? I adjust “HEADER SIZE” to remove non image data but i cant figure the pattern.</p>

<p>Try the raw image guess extension.  If you don’t see any pattern it’s also possible the image is compressed and further reverse engineering is needed.</p>

    Thank you I will do what you have recommended. 
Just for clarity, on the button Display ROI what does it mean (ROI) ? 
The X Y Z Spacing means the the size of the model I think, so if the fetus is 31 CM from Cranium to Coccyx then how do I calibrate correctly or at least very close?
