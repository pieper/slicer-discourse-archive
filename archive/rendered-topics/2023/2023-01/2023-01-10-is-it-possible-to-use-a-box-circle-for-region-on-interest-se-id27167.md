<p>So basically what I want to do is using a box or region of interest (in 3 different views) to encapsulate a part of the liver/spleen that I want to be segmentated. I tried using the segment editor, but I can’t find the functionality i’m looking for.</p>
<p>Is there also a way to convert a DICOM to a NIFTI file format?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>yes I have the same problem to add a feature or a model, then I have a little idea to locate the part you want to segment through the tool CROP VOLUME and to convert DCIM to NIFTI format you can use free online converter</p>

<p>Is there a way that I can use volume rendering to annotate or segment the box that it creates?</p>
<p>So with volume rendering I’m achieving what I want in terms focussing on the region that i want to be segmented/masked and export as a NIFTI file.</p>

<p>I’ve already tried to do, I don’t think there’s any way to do this<br>
volume rendering it only gives you a vision on the segmentation in 3D form</p>
