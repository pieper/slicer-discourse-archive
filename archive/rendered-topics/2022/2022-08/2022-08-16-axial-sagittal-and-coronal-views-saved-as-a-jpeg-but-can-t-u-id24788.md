<p>Hi all!</p>
<p>New to the community here but hoping someone can provide some guidance.<br>
I was handed a case with the axial, sagittal, and coronal views were in separate folders saved as a JPEG. I am looking to segment the mandible in this case, and I was hoping there’s a way to upload all three sets and have slicer let me assign the sets to their respective views for segmenting. However, it seems there is more work involved to get the images aligned and of proper size.<br>
I have tried to use ImageStacks and it makes it easy to upload but the spacing I can’t seem to get right.</p>
<p>Any guidance here would be much appreciated</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
