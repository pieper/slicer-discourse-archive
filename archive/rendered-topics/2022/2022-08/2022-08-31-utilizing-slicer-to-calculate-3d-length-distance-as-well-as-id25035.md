<p>Hello All,</p>
<p>I’m new to the Slicer community and having a little difficulty getting started on a project.</p>
<p>I am looking to calculate 3D length measurements as well as surface area measurements for a set of cranial CT scans (DICOM data). I was hoping to get the Slicer Community’s opinion on the best way to go about solving a problem like this.</p>
<p>I’ve done my best to look through the forums here online, but I believe I might be so new to the program that I’m a bit overwhelmed by all of the different tools/extensions.</p>
<p>I’m sure many of the power users here in the community could make quick work of a task like this, so I am very grateful for any assistance you may be able to offer.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>It sounds like you can get what you need from either markups or segment statistics.  If there’s anything  not covered let us know.</p>
