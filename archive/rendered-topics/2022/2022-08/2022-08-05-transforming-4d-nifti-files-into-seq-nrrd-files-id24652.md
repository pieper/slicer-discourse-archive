<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>I wonder if there is a script to transform 4D nii files into seq.nnrd files to annalyze the Data with the sequences module?</p>
<p>I have several 4D nii files and it would be very convenient being able to transform them in one step rather than loading all the files into slicer and save them as .nrrd</p>
<p>Thanks for your help and suggestions<br>
best Florian</p>
