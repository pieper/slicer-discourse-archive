<p>Hi,<br>
I am new to slicer.<br>
I have a MRI scan of the shoulder broken down into several DICOM series with several images, each. I would like to build one volume from these series. Using the DICOM importer, I manage to import the separate series as separate scalar volumes, but not as one volume. Is it possible to combine these volumes into one?<br>
Thanks</p>
