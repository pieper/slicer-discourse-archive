<p>Operating system:Windows 10<br>
Slicer version:5.0.3<br>
Expected behavior: Starting from an image sequence dataset, I have created a volume that displays both in the 3D viewer and as an available choice in such modules as Volume Render. I would expect this volume to be available from the “Input Volume” list in the module’s menu.<br>
Actual behavior: In Grayscale Model Maker, volume list is empty, even if I rename the volume or save the scene and volume information beforehand.</p>
