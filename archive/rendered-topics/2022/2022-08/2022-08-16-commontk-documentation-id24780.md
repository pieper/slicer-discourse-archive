<p>Hello all,</p>
<p>I’ve started playing around with writing Scriptable Extensions in Slicer.  I wanted to try some CommonTK widgets, but I had trouble finding documentation.  The <a href="http://www.commontk.org/index.php/Documentation/ImageGallery" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Image Gallery</a> on the Common TK website is helpful as an overview of what’s available, but it seems like all the Doxygen links are broken.  Is this supposed to be case?  Is there another place to find documentation on CTK widgets?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>The CommonTk doxygen servers were set up a long time ago and perhaps they aren’t pointing to a valid server anymore.  <a class="mention" href="/u/jcfr">@jcfr</a> may know more?</p>
<p>In any case I’d suggest just looking at the header files to see the same information in source form.</p>
