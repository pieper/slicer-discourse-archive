<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>I am trying to set up two different fonts for a QPushButton, however, the existing one only support one font.<br>
I would like to make a RichPushButton derived from QPushButton to support different fonts, and add to the Widget Box in Qt Designer for the UI/*.ui design for my own module in Slicer.</p>
<p>Assume that I wrote a Python script for class RichPushButton, how can I add it to the Slicer Qt Designer?</p>
<p>Thank you so much in advance!</p>
