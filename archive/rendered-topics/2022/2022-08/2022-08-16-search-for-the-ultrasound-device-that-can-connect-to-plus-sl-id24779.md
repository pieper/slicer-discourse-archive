<p>Dear all, Here I  want to use slicer’s segmentation module to extract a small segment of femoral veins, please recommend an ultrasound probe that can be directly connected to Slicer(Plus), or some Handheld Ultrasound Equipment. At present, the data exported by Philips ultrasound equipment has some inconveniences due to the need for Qlab format conversion.<br>
Thanks。</p>
