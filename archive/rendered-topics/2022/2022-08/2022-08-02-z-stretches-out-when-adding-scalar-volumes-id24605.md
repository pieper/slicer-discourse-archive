<p>I am currently trying to stitch together multiple microCT volumes and I have transformed the volumes manually to align them alongside creating a reference volume that spans the whole thing. While my sliceview shows the whole volume as correct, when I render, the volume is stretched in the z direction and does not include all of the images I have stitched together. I’m new to slicer and hope you guys can help me. Thanks!</p>

<p><a class="mention" href="/u/mikebind">@mikebind</a> has created a <a href="https://github.com/mikebind/SlicerSandbox/tree/master/StitchVolumes">module for stitching volumes</a>. You can use this module as is, or get inspiration from it for your own script.</p>
