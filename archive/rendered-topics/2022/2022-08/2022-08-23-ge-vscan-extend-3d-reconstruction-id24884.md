<p>Hi, I am a Masters Student trying to use a GE Vscan Extend Ultrasound to perform a 3D reconstruction in real-time for my project. However, I don’t think 3DslicerIGT is compatible with GE. Then I saw a forum where you can receive images in real-time from some GE scanners by signing up to the GE’s Edison Developer Program, but I need to be a company to actually sign up for it. Is there another way to do a 3D reconstruction in real-time with the GE ultrasound? If not, do I have to take a lot of images of 1 object and convert it into a 3D model?</p>
<p>Thank you very much</p>
