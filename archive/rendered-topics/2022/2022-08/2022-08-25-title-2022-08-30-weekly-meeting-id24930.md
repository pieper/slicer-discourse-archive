<p>Let’s also talk about nifti and whether we should update the preview to the latest ITK in order to support <a href="https://discourse.slicer.org/t/error-loading-nifti-file/24911/5">files like this</a>.</p>

<p>Is it appropriate to join to ask questions about an extension that I’m developing? Or does this meeting aim to focus primarily on the main Slicer development?</p>
