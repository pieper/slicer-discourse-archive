<p>Hello,<br>
We have 4DCT data in DICOM format. I would like to segment the liver between different respiratory phases and DIR those two to get the DVF data as numerical values. The segmentation has been completed, but I want to DIR and obtain the DVF in the liver contoured on the CT image. Could you please tell me how I can solve this problem? Thnak you in advance for your help.</p>
