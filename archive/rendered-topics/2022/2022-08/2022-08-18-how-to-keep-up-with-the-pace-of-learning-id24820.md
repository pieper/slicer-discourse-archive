<p>The new version of Slicer is released very fast, and the new extension modules are also very powerful. I would like to ask you how to keep up with the pace of learning.</p>

<p>It’s true, this is a very active community so it’s hard to keep up.  Watching this forum and the github repositories is the best way I know of.  Also try to attend the <a href="https://projectweek.na-mic.org/">Project Weeks</a> if possible, or read the pages about projects.</p>
