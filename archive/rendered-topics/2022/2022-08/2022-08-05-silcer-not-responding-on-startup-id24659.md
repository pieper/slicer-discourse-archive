<p>Hi,</p>
<p>When I try to run 3DSlicer, the window that opens is just a white screen and I cannot even click “ok” in the popup that opens (that says 3DSlicer is not intended for medical use). The program does not respond and eventually shuts down. Are there any troubleshooting methods I can try to fix this? I tried reinstalling 3DSlicer into two different drivers but that did no good either.</p>
<p>I would appreciate any help. Thanks</p>

<p>Please add some information about what computer you are using and how you access it (i.e. is this a remote desktop session or local monitor).</p>
