<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I’ve noticed that the draw function of the segment editor doesn’t work on some axial CT images, while the paint function works fine.  Interestingly, the draw function works on the sagittal plane, but I’d like to keep axial plane as the primary plane for segmentation.</p>
<p>This problem persists in both old and the most recent version of Slicer.</p>
<p>Any suggestion will be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>
DJ</p>
