<p>Hello everyone, I desperately need your help.</p>
<p>I have segmentation with needed anatomical structures… Today, by accident I have added one more structure (skin) but unfortunately, I have lost other organs and didn’t realize it… and save the segmentation (and overwrite the old, good one).<br>
Is there any chance, hope, that I can restore my previous segmentation???</p>

<p>Unless your operating system offers a file recovery, this is out of Slicer’s hand. On windows there is something called File History, and if it is enabled you might be able to recover. Right click on the file and choose “Previous Versions” (or right click and choose properties and navigate to the tab called Previous versions). I think Mac has a similar service too.</p>
