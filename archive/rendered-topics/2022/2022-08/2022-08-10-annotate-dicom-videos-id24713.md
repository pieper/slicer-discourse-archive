<p>Operating system: Windows<br>
Slicer version:4.11.20210226<br>
Expected behavior: Annotate one frame and have it across all other frames for a single study.<br>
Actual behavior: Can annotate one frame and save it but cannot have it for other frames.</p>
<p>Is there a way to annotate one frame of a video DICOM file and have it for all frames for the entire DICOM file?</p>

<p>What kind of annotation you mean? Burning in some text or drawing in each slice of a volume?</p>
