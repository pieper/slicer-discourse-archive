<p>Dear Friends,<br>
When I analyze the PWI images in the module of MultiVolumExplorer, I find out the plotting of PWI is too choppy when I move my mouse on the PWI images. The corresponding speed of the plotting is very delayed and the chart of a LabelMapvolume also can not be produced. This phenomenon didn’t appear in the old version. Who can tell me haw to solve this? Thanks a lot.</p>
