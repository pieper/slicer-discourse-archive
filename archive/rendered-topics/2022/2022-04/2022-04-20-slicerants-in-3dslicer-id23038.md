<p>Dear All,</p>
<p>I have not found the SlicerANTs extension in the extension manager (I use Slicer 4.11 version), Furthermore, when I install it via GitHub I cannot find it anywhere among extensions.</p>
<p>Do you have any idea how to solve this issue?</p>
<p>Kind Regards,</p>

<p>SlicerAnts is not available for the latest stable release (Slicer 4.11.20210226). You will have to use the latest Slicer Preview release which you can download from <a href="https://download.slicer.org/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://download.slicer.org/</a>. Using this latest version you will be able to install SlicerAnts from the Extensions Manager.</p>
