<p>Hello, I am trying to export RT Plan, RT Dose and RT Struct. When I export a study to DICOM and select RT export type, it only detects the image volume, RT Dose and RT Struct, which are exported correctly but RT Plan is missing. Does anyone have previous experience with exporting an RT Plan? Thank you!</p>

<p>Unfortunately DICOM export of the plan is not supported.</p>

<p>Ok, thank you for the information. Would you know other libraries/apps that can create and export an RT Plan?</p>
