<p>Can I migrate the 3D slicer view and measurement functions directly to my own Python program? If I can, what information do I need to learn or check</p>

<p>Is there anything unclear or unanswered from your original post in January (linked below)?</p>

    I would like to ask, can I add the measurement length and angle of 3dslicer and the function of cutting the segmented 3D view to my own Python program. Is to run their own Python program, and then display the divided 3D view, and on this view, cut, length and angle measurement？

<p>Yes, in my post in January, I got the reply that I can write modules in Python in 3dslicer, but what I need is to migrate some modules of 3dslicer to my own Python program. For example, when I run my own code, a window program similar to 3dslicer will be displayed</p>
