<p>For some reason, I could not paint certain pictures (early scans of the series) of a volume. I could not even paint on the most bright area regardless of the threshold settings. Has anyone encountered similar problem and how you solve it? Thank you so much in advance!</p>

<p>I can paint again after playing geometry of the master volume. I changed the oversampling factor to some a number and then changed it back to 1. it made the difference!! Thank you so much!!</p>
