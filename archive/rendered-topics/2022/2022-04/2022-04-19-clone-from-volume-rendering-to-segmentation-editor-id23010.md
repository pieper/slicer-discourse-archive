<p>Greetings!</p>
<p>I apologize if this question has been asked previously.</p>
<p>I have found that in many cases the quality of the volumes rendered under ‘Volume Rendering’ far surpasses my dismal attempts at creating equivalent segments using the segmentation editor. Is there any way to be able to clone a rendered volume (partial or otherwise given a suitable set of parameters) to a new or existing segment?</p>
<p>Many thanks.</p>
