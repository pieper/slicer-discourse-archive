<p>I have noticed the following message at <a href="https://www.radiomics.io/slicerradiomics.html" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Radiomics</a>. Is it correct. It must be because I cannot find Slicer Radiomics in the extension manager currently.</p>
<p>Pending resolution of packaging issues, SlicerRadiomics is not currently distributed as an extension via the 3D Slicer ExtensionManager. You can however use this extension if you build SlicerRadiomics from source.</p>

<p>SlicerRadiomics extension is available for the latest Slicer Stable Release and <a class="mention" href="/u/jcfr">@jcfr</a> is working on making it available in the upcoming new stable release (Slicer5).</p>
<p>See also <a href="https://discourse.slicer.org/t/the-slicerradiomics-module-and-many-other-modules-are-not-found-in-the-latest-version/23050/3" class="inline-onebox">The slicerRadiomics module and many other modules are not found in the latest version - #3 by lassoan</a></p>

<p>Andras,<br>
Yes. You are correct. I installed the latest “stable” version and could find the SlicerRadiomics". Thank you very much for your prompt response and help.<br>
