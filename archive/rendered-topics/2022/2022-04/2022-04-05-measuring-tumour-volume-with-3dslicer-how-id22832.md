<p>I will be using 3D Slicer heavily for my thesis. From a range of CT scans the project will require me for each scan, to (a) determine liver tumour volume in the canine b) determine that as a % of total liver volume c) correlate that with postoperative survival. I will then create 3d photorealistic 3D models to provide vet surgeons with better insight into the spatial relationship of this structure. These 3D models will eventually be integrated into a simple interactive visualization interface allowing for further exploration.</p>
<p>Can anyone explain how I can measure the liver volume in the slicer? Thanks in advance. Sandie</p>

<p>First to creat the tumor model with SegmentEditor,then turn to the Model module,the information will show you the volume.</p>

<p>Thank you for your swift response. So how do I determine the tumour volume within the liver? I assume I segment that separately?</p>
