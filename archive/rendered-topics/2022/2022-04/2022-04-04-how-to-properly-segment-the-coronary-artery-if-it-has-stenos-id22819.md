<p>hello, I’m having difficulty segmenting the coronary arteries in the area of stenosis. tell me how to properly segment the coronary artery, if it has stenosis?<br>
I need the artery to become narrower in the area of stenosis. I use the instrument “threshold”, but a hole appears in the artery, not a narrowing.</p>
