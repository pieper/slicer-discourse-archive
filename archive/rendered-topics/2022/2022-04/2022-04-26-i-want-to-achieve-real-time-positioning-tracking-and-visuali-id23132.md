<p>Hi, if you check the tutorials on this page: <a href="http://www.slicerigt.org/wp/user-tutorial/" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">User tutorial | SlicerIGT</a><br>
those might help you start in the right direction.<br>
Especially the last one, U-37 is meant to be a complete example of how to build a navigation system.<br>
You will need a position tracking device (optical or electromagnetic) and the PLUS software (<a href="http://www.plustoolkit.org" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">www.plustoolkit.org</a>) that facilitates communication between the tracking device and 3D Slicer.</p>

<p>Thank you very much for your answer! Another problem is that in the slicer IGT tutorial, the create model module can only build a needle model when building a model. I want to build a more complex model such as a scalpel model, and then implement the scalpel model in the visual interface. location tracking and visualization, would like to ask you how to achieve this.</p>
