<p>Dear all,</p>
<p>I have a set of knees’ MRI where, a soon as imported, I can only see 1 qualitative view atthe time: when the sagittal set is correct, the coronal and the axial are confused and not usable.</p>
<p>My question is if its possible to merge the different good sagittal, axial, and coronal view so I can use all the three correct view to segment and create a good 3d model.</p>
<p>The anonymized MRI are here:</p>
