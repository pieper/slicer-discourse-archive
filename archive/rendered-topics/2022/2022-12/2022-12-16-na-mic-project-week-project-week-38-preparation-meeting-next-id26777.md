<p>Dear Project Week community,</p>
<p>Our next Project Week preparation meeting will take place next Tuesday, December 20th 2022 (10 am Boston time, EDT) on Zoom. This time, we will focus on the planning of breakout sessions and in particular, we want to propose a <strong>panel discussion</strong> with <strong>clinicians using Slicer</strong> in their practice and research. If you are working with clinicians at any levels who might be interested in the discussion, please invite them to join.</p>
<p>You can join using the following link which will remain the same for all preparation meetings:</p>

<p>Project Week#38 will be held Jan 27- Feb 3, 2023 in Las Palmas, Gran Canaria, Spain. The format of this edition of Project Week will be hybrid, with a strong in-person component. Please look here for additional details: <a href="https://projectweek.na-mic.org/PW38_2023_GranCanaria/" class="inline-onebox">Welcome to the web page for the 38th Project Week! | NA-MIC Project Weeks</a></p>
<p><em>Preparation</em> : To prepare, we will be holding weekly meetings at 10am on Tuesdays, starting <strong>Nov 29th, 2021</strong> and ending on January 24. Please join at <a href="https://etsmtl.zoom.us/j/86211702920?pwd=TEl0ZTFDam90WVN5bjZhR05kNVRVZz09">this link</a> if you have a project that you would like to present or work on during project week.</p>
<p><em>Background</em> : The Project Week is a week-long hackathon of hands on activity in which medical image computing researchers create solutions using the open source image computing platform, 3D Slicer, and VTK, ITK, CMake, and CDash libraries as well as OHIF, Cornerstone, dcmjs, vtkjs, itkjs, DICOMweb, Girder and related web technologies. Participants work collaboratively on solutions that lie at the interfaces of the fields of computer science, mechanical engineering, biomedical engineering, and medicine. In contrast to conferences and workshops where the primary focus is to report results, the objective of the ProjectWeek is to provide a venue for creators of medical image computing open-source software creators to collaboratively work.</p>
