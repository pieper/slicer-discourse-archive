<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>I’m using pyradiomics to extract features from blobs, and I just wanted to make sure that the features I am extracting are rotation and translation invariant - i.e., the object’s orientation and location inside the image should not matter. Is this the case for all of the features stated here?</p>
