<p>Can Anybody tell me how to modiphy spacing and thickness of a DICOM file. I think it’s a function of the Crop Module, but I can’t find how to use it.</p>
<p>Thank you very much</p>

<p>To change pixel spacing and distance between slices using Crop volume module, type a value in <code>Spacing scale</code>. You can see the resulting voxel spacing values in the <code>Volume information</code> section.</p>
