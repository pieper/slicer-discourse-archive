<p>If you did not already review the tutorial and video associated with the <code>Slicer Lung CT Analyzer</code> extension, you will find <a href="https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/Nightly/Training#Slicer4_Lung_CT_Analyzer">here</a> details on how to visualize and quantify infiltration, emphysema and collapsed lung areas in CT datasets acquired on COVID-19 patients.</p>
