<p>Dear Community,<br>
I have some cine MRI images of the heart (in short axis and axial views). I want to generate a biventricular surface mesh using the image segmentation method. Can I use the “Segmentations” module in 3DSlicer to do that? Does this module work for cine MRI segmentation?<br>
I would highly appreciate it if you could guide me about this.</p>
