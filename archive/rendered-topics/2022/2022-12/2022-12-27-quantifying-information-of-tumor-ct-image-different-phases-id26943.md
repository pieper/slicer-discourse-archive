<p>I’m working with multiphase CT images of liver tumors. Visually we see better demarcation of tumors and intricate enhancement pattern within tumors on arterial phase vs portal venous phase.</p>
<p>Has anyone tried to use quantitative measurement for such an observation? Perhaps something as simple as a t-test vs some form of Shannon Entropy measurement using a histogram of the tumor voxels?</p>
