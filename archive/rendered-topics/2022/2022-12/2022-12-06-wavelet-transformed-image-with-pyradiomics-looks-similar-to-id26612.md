<p>Dear 3D Slicer community,</p>
<p>I used pyradiomics for image transformation applied all filters.<br>
I noticed that the image transformed with the LLL Wavelet Kernel looks very similar to the original image.</p>
<p>Am I overlooking something or might this be a bug?</p>
<p>I am using the imageoperations.getWaveletImage function.</p>
<p>Best,<br>
Jonas</p>
