<p>Slicer 3D does not work on Monterey<br>
Do you have a solution<br>
I am going to buy a PC on Windows 10 will it work better ?<br>
Could you give me some help on this PC configuration to be able to use Slicer 3D easally ?</p>

<p>I’ve been using Slicer on Monterey for months, no issues, on a 2019 MacBook Pro 16, 64GB RAM, AMD Radeon Pro 5500M 8 GB.</p>
<p>What Mac model/configuration are you using?</p>
