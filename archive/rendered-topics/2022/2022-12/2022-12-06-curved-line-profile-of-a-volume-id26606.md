<p>Thank you.<br>
I’m looking to get a curved line profile from a volume, however it seems that the Line Profile tool does not include in the current software and I found some answers to get line profile, but, I could not get it. Do you have any option? Thank you.</p>

<p>“Line profile” module is provided by Sandbox extension. You can <a href="https://slicer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/extensions_manager.html#install-extensions">install it by a few clicks in the Extensions Manager</a>.</p>

<p>If you need intensity profile along a curve, then it may be simpler to straighten the volume using Curved Planar Reformat module and then measure along a straight line.</p>
