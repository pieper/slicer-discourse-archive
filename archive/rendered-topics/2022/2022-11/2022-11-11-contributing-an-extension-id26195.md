<p>Hello! I’ve created a pull request for my extension, but I was wondering what is the average time untill the extension can be available in the extension manager?</p>

<p>We usually get to review an extension submission within a few days, but we are currently in the process of releasing the new Slicer-5.2 version, so I don’t think anybody had the time. I’ll have a look at it today. Thank you for your submission and sorry for the delay.</p>
