<p>I have registered two lung CT images using elastix deformable registration module and saved the transformation matrix as a h5 file. I realize if I apply the transformation matrix into an identical copy of the same moving volume, the first and second deformed volumns would have some difference. Desipte the minimal differences, I am curious what causes such deviation. Is there some loss of matrix data if I save the transformation into an external file?</p>
