<p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>how do I detect the signal intensity in an MRI image in order to be able to calculate the signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) and -contrast-to-noise-ratio (CNR) in for example the liver and the air?</p>
<p>I’d appreciate any help! Thank you.</p>

<p>You can measure SNR in MRI using the <a href="https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/Nightly/Modules/MRI_SNR_Measurement">SNRMeasurement extension</a>.</p>
