<p>Hi:</p>
<p>In version 4.11.20210226 when I used to press “F” while placing the mouse cursor on top of a model in the 3D view, the camera got centered where I pressed the button.</p>
<p>Is there any way to set up a keyboard shortcut (using a python script) with the same functionallity?</p>
<p>Thank you for your attention in advance.</p>

<p>You can right-click on a markup point and choose “Refocus camera on this point”.</p>

<p>Thank you for your answer Andras :))</p>
<p>It isn’t as comfortable as a keyboar shortcut but it certainly does what I need so I will use that.</p>
