<p>Hi there!</p>
<p>I have an MRI-spine scan of a patient and out of that, I am trying to create a 3d model of the spinal nerves.I tried the segment editor-&gt; new segment-&gt; nerve-&gt;Threshold but it is not that precise. I am 2 days old in this ,I hope someone can help me.</p>
<p>Have a nice one!<br>

<p>Without seeing the actual images, my guess would be that this is a very challenging segmentation task.  If you can clearly see the nerves when you scroll through the data then there’s a good chance you can use manual tools, such as the paint brush, and perhaps the Grow from seeds or Fill between slices tools to make the work more efficient but I guess it’s not easy.  Perhaps if you can post a screenshot you might get additional suggestions.</p>
