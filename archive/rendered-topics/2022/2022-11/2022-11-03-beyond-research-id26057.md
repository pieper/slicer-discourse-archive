<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am looking for a software that I can earn some money.</p>
<p>I have found 3d slicer and I am happy with that.</p>
<p>But it stars that only for research.</p>
<p>Do 3d slicer have paid version? For 3d print, and model for use in medical oprrations.</p>
<p>Any alternative?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance</p>
<p>Best regards</p>

<p>I’m not sure what your background is, but if you get good at Slicer you could find jobs helping people analyze their data, even in a research setting.  It is important to be careful about using research software in the context of providing medical care and you need to be sure you are following local laws and other regulations.  There is no paid version of Slicer.</p>
