<p>Hello everyone.<br>
I am using the latest stable version of 3Dslicer and I came across a problem:<br>
I want to open DICOM images as a single series and be able to view them consequently, however the software recognizes each of the images as a single series. I tried running patching to no avail. I would really appreciate if Some one could give me some pointers on what to do.<br>
Thank you all very much<br>
Sincerely<br>
Moe</p>
