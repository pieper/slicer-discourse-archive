<p>I need to make a model of a nerve which I successfully did using MarkupsToModel in slicer but I need to be able to export this tube as an STL… is this possible? If not I need to find a new way to segment the nerve.</p>

<p>MarkupsToModel output models are surface meshes that you can directly <a href="https://slicer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/data_loading_and_saving.html#save-data">save</a> or <a href="https://slicer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/data_loading_and_saving.html#export-data">export</a> to STL file.</p>
