<p>Hi all, I want to change the structure of the slicer installation directory, like put all the libraries in one folder. What should I know about? Is there any information I can refer to?</p>

<p>The folder structure follows widely used standard conventions, with good reasons what to put where. Is there a specific reason you want to move files around?</p>
