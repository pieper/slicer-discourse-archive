<p>Tomorrow, we will be having our next weekly hangout at <strong>11:00 AM ET until 12:00PM ET</strong>.  The time slot has been shifted due to the <a href="https://discourse.slicer.org/t/na-mic-project-week-project-week-38-prep-meetings-start-this-tuesday-nov-29th/26484">Project Week preparation calls</a>.</p>
<p>We will likely be re-using the <a href="https://etsmtl.zoom.us/j/86211702920?pwd=TEl0ZTFDam90WVN5bjZhR05kNVRVZz09">Project Week zoom call link</a> as we have done previously.</p>

<p>Agenda:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://slicer.cdash.org/index.php?project=SlicerPreview#!#Extensions-Nightly" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Extension dashboard status</a></li>
<li><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zPkAXym6_PDB1bBwekV3zGFYAs1viRQyJ2lSrP4B4DE/edit?usp=sharing">5.2 Release Notes</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Please post to this thread to put a topic on the agenda!  We will try to prioritize agenda items during the meeting.</p>
<p>Thanks<br>
Sam and J-Christophe</p>
