<p>Hello All,</p>
<p>I am looking for autosave functionality in slicer because what happen if power cut and i did not save my work. Can we use autosave in parallel thread without interrupting the work ? if yes then how ?</p>
<p>Another thing is everytime i have to open the save dialog and click on save button . From my understanding is better to asks information of destination and filename once and afterwards we just have to simply press ctrl+s without opening any save dialog</p>

<p>AutoSave module is available in Sandbox extension.</p>
<p>You can also save the scene by hitting Ctrl-S, Enter, A or by <a href="https://slicer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer_guide/script_repository.html#keyboard-shortcuts-and-mouse-gestures">specifying a keyboard shortcut</a>.</p>
