<p>Hi,</p>
<p>We wrote a blog to share our preliminary experience experimenting with different options available to deploy monai models within 3D Slicer.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kitware.com/deploying-your-monai-machine-learning-model-within-3d-slicer/" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://www.kitware.com/deploying-your-monai-machine-learning-model-within-3d-slicer/</a></p>
<p>This work is led by <a class="mention" href="/u/lee_newberg">@Lee_Newberg</a>  with a lot of support from <a class="mention" href="/u/ebrahim">@ebrahim</a>.</p>
<p>We plan to continue to update this blog as we deploy monai in several of our other customized Slicer applications.</p>
<p>Please let us know if you have any questions, comments, or suggestions.</p>
<p>Thank you<br>
Andinet</p>
