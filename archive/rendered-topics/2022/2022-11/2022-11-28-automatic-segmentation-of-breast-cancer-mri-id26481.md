<p>Hi, I’m using 3dslicer, and I checked out the tutorials already, but they are mostly on brain MRI. Is there a way to automatically segment a Brest MRI to detect tumor and hopefully its features.</p>

<p>Search for publications on fully automatic breast MRI segmentation and see if the authors make the segmentation models available. If nobody makes them available or they don’t work well enough, then you can train your own AI model using MONAILabel extension.</p>
