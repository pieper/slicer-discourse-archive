<p>Hello,<br>
I am new user here.<br>
How to create a feature map of any pyradiomics features in 3D slicer? how we can show it like an image given in the example?<br>
<img src="https://us1.discourse-cdn.com/flex002/uploads/slicer/original/3X/c/e/ce9092ed12f92d952a95cc6cb5a28f9531da8d89.jpeg" alt="FM" data-base62-sha1="ttm6DNOKTLJcDV59uNJwpv7AXJ7" width="160" height="373"></p>
<p>Here an example image is uploaded (The top image shows the original image T2 overlaid with the Whole tumor and at the bottom, it shows the feature map of one of GLSZM feature map in the foreground and T2 is in the background)<br>
Many thanks.</p>
