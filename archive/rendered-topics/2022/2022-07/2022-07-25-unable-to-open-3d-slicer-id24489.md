<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am running Windows 10, and I’m having issues opening the 3D Slicer app. A couple months ago, I had downloaded version 5.0.2, and after installing it, I was able to open and use the program without any issues. I tried opening it again yesterday, and the program just showed a black screen. So, I uninstalled it, and I downloaded the newest version (5.0.3). Again, after installing the program, I was able to open and use the app. However, when I tried to open 3D Slicer today, I was once again presented with a black screen. I have tried restarting my computer, as well as uninstalling and reinstalling version 5.0.3, but I still can’t open it.</p>
<p>If anyone has any ideas about how this might be fixed, that would be much appreciated! Thank you!</p>

<p>Hi HannahD<br>
Are you using any anti virus software? If thats the case try to see if slicerapp is put in quarentine, and then allow that file to run on your computer and add an exception in your antivirus software.</p>
