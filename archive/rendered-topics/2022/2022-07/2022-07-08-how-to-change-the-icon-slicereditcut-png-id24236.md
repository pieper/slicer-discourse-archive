<p>How would you like to change the Scissors icon so that we can improve it for Slicer users? Does the current design not represent the effect well? Is the cursor icon too large or too small? Can you show screenshots of what you dislike and include a mockup of what you may desire?</p>

<p>The scissors icon is too large for me. I want to change it to half the previous size. I see that there is a small icon in the slicer code, but I can’t find how to modify it</p>
