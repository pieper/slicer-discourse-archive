<p>It does not happen on Linux, though. This looks to me like a compiler issue more than a library standard issue</p>

<p>Looks like <a class="mention" href="/u/lassoan">@lassoan</a> has a fix in progress: <a href="https://github.com/SCIInstitute/Cleaver2/pull/119" class="inline-onebox">COMP: Fix Cxx17 build error by lassoan · Pull Request #119 · SCIInstitute/Cleaver2 · GitHub</a></p>
<p>Most of the errors are related to the removal of <code>auto_ptr</code> in C++ 17.</p>
