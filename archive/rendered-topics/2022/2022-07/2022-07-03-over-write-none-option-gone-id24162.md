<p>Hi, I am working on 4.13.0 version; Can you tell me why in threshold; the overwrite NONE option is no longer available? What do I use instead?</p>

<p>Take a look at the masking documentation below. “Overwrite none” —&gt; “Allow overlap”. This change was originally included in Slicer 4.11.20200930, but instead of continuing to use Slicer 4.13 I would recommend that you download latest stable Slicer 5.0.2 from <a href="https://download.slicer.org/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://download.slicer.org/</a>.</p>

<p>Thank you! I’m downloading the stable version 5.0.2, am I able to open scenes from my previous version on the new one?</p>
