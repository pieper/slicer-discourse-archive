<p>Operating system: Windows<br>
Slicer version:4.11.20210226<br>
Expected behavior: Annotate one frame and have it across all other frames for a single study.<br>
Actual behavior: Can annotate one frame and save it but cannot have it for other frames.</p>
<p>I have a Swallow study. It looks like a 2d, 30 fps ~1min long x-ray like videos(not like 3d CAT scan). I want to annotate one frame and have that annotation stay over all frames.<br>
So far, I can annotate but the annotation is specific to a single frame rather than for all frames for a single video. Can anyone share a tutorial or a guide on how to do this?</p>

<p>Any suggestions on where I can find useful resources related to annotating a swallow study using 3D Slicer?</p>
