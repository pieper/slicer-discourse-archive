<p>This is a bit of a continuation of <a href="https://discourse.slicer.org/t/importing-label-maps-with-multivolumeimporter-as-segmentations/24458">this</a> topic. I have a set of volumes which are “4D” meaning they are 3D nifti files which span over a period of time. I also have pre-made corresponding segmentations in the same format. Using the sequences module I am able to import both of them as volume sequences and segmentation sequences respectively. I am unable to add the segmentations to the volume node (as a proxy node?). I have followed the documentation to the best of my abilities as well as several other methods and am still stumped. If I could get some help with this that would be greatly appreciated.</p>
