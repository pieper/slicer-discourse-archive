<p>After the last update, there are some problems with the tool. The application began to lag after creating 3D reconstructions, although before I did them with a much larger number of objects. And when I use Smoothing, then in general the application stop working and I should turn it off because it does not respond to any commands.<br>
Who has already encountered this and how is it possible to solve this problem? My PC is powerful. If already the Witcher Wild Hunt is easily going on, then it should definitely be able to cope with  3D Slicer <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/smile.png?v=12" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>
