<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I am trying to clip more than one branch with vmtkBranchClipper in python. I’ve tried doing this both interactively and through supplying a GroupIds list. When I supply one GroupId, i.e. clip one branch, the clipping works. However when I supply more than one groupid the clipping does not work. The surface stays unclipped.<br>
vmtk version 1.5.0, python 3.10.4, WIndows 11,</p>
