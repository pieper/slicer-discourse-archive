<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am trying to develop a module where I need to create a hollow hemisphere whose parameters such as inner radius and outer radius can be varied as per command of the user. I am able to perform the required operation with the sphere, but am finding it difficult to do the same with the hemisphere. Does anyone knows if there is some other module which caters to same options?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
