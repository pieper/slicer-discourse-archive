<p>Operating system:mac0s<br>
Slicer version: 5.0.3<br>
Expected behavior:<br>
Actual behavior: I am having difficulty in obtaining radiomic values from regions of interest drawn on .dcm ultrasound images. In particular, when I select the different features on the radiomics panel, the apply button does not become activated. it doesn’t happen all the time and occasionally i can get radiomic results from the same scan. Can some one provide guidance or insight on how to fix this issue?</p>
<p>Thanks<br>
Ron</p>
