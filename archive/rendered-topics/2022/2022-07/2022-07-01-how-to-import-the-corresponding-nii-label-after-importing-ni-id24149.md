<p>How to import the corresponding NII label(multiple labels) after importing NII data, so that they overlap with each other (consistent with the function segment edit)? Please help me! thx</p>

<p>You can load segmentation from a NIFTI file by selecting “Segmentation” in the “Description” column in “Add data” window - see <a href="https://slicer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/modules/segmentations.html#import-an-existing-segmentation-from-volume-file" class="inline-onebox">Segmentations — 3D Slicer documentation</a></p>
