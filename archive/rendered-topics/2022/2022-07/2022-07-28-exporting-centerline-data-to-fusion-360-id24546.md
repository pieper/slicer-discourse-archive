<p>Hello!</p>
<p>I am trying to take a Centerline and bring it into Fusion 360 in the same orientation.  Is it possible to convert it into a spline or some sort to be able to refrence it in Fusion 360?  No matter what format I download the centerline in I am unable to open it in Fusion 360 or any other application really.</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>Did you find a solution? I tried to export in stl file, and I still couldn’t open the file in Ultimaker Cura?</p>
<p>Cheers</p>
