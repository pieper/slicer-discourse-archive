<p>First, pleasure to be part of this discussion group. I am a newbie on this topic and struggling how to address on of the research someone has requested me to have a look. Objective is to analyze the likely progression of a traumatic brain injury based on some clinical attributes and CT scans with a expected outcome of Good or Bad progress training a predefined  or custom CNN .  So far, my understanding having a technical background in IT might be,</p>
<ol>
<li>Get all CT scans associated to each patient and linked them with clinical attributes (age…) in a CSV file</li>
<li>Normalize and standarize data.</li>
</ol>
<p>Several questions that come to my mind.</p>
<ol>
<li>How can I get features from CT scans with no masks using PyRadiomics. I dont really exactly know where to get them.</li>
<li>Whats the preferred CNN to use? Any previous use case to address it?</li>
<li>Dicom vs Nifty. Whats the best format? Should I use ITK for this purpose?</li>
</ol>
<p>Any helpful hint how to start or any valuable guidance will be welcome</p>
