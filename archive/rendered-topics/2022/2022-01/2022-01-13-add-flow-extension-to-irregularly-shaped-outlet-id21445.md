<p>I am trying to add a flow extension to an outlet using vmtkflowextensions. However, the outlet has a very irregular shape due to the presence of plaque, and the added flow extension does not fit the outlet very well:<br>

Is there anything I can do to make the flow extension fit better to the outlet?</p>
