<p>I’ve got the DICOM files of a mouse head. Using the grow from seeds method in Segment Editor, one tooth from the jaw has been selected and rendered into a 3D volume. Is it possible to get volume dimensions from about the tooth like how many cubic millimeters it is?</p>

<p>You can use the Segment Statistics module for that.</p>
