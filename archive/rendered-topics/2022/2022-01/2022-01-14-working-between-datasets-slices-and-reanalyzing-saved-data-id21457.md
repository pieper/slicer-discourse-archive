<p>Hey everyone!<br>
I am a student from Rush University and we are working on a project which analyzes muscle area and hounsefield units on CT scans of the L3 region in hospitalized patients.</p>
<p>The major issues that occur are in regard to working between images and trying to figure out if we can reanalyze/correct saved work. When I work on a slice I set a threshold to mark up the muscle area (-30 to 150) but for some reason the brush does not work when loading a new image into the slicer program.  Currently, I have to close and reopen the program and redo every step to successfully paint the muscle area in the new image. Is there a way how to use the threshold brush for every image that I load into the program without reselecting threshold parameters?</p>
<p>My next question is about the possibility to reload/reanalyze a slice that has been measured with the software and saved. For example, when I save the image with the measured data, is it possible to reopen that image because a part of the image was brushed/selected wrongly to be corrected?</p>
