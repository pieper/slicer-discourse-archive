<p>Not sure this is the right section to ask, anyway my question it’s not related to Slicer usage.</p>
<p>Looking at these examples</p><aside class="quote quote-modified" data-post="1" data-topic="19732">

  <blockquote>
    In recent Slicer Preview Releases, color volume rendering has been made much easier to access. While previously an alpha channel had to be created manually for rendering color RGB volumes, now the alpha channel is created automatically (from the luminance of the image). 
To render an RGB volume, just load the image stack and drag-and-drop the volume from the Data module to a 3D view (or use Volume Rendering module). When a color volume is loaded then “Scalar Color Mapping” section is not display…

<p>
wanted to ask if someone know or has an idea where to search for other RGBA or anyway colored volume dataset of the head.</p>
<p>I think these data can come only from cryogenic slicing projects, since I didn’t know any other technique able to produce a colored volume, but might be wrong.</p>
