<p>Hey all,<br>
I’m looking at writing a script that automates some slicer functionality. To make it easier for deployment I’m looking at ways to find where a current version of slicer is installed on windows.<br>
Naturally I’m looking at windows registry but I’m not sure where to find the key that would point to 3D slicer installed location.</p>
<p>Any tips are much appreciated.</p>
