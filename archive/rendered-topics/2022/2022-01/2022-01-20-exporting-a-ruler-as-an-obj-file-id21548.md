<p>Hello Everyone,</p>
<p>I was playing with exporting segments as .obj files to visualize them in VR. As we loose exact dimensions when we export an .obj file, I was wondering if there is any way that we can export a ruler (or some type of measurement image) as a .obj file as well. That way, if you are visualizing multiple segments grouped together, then the ruler will allow a rough estimate of the dimensions. Any thoughts?</p>

<p>Maybe paint a sphere or disk with known radius in the corner?</p>
