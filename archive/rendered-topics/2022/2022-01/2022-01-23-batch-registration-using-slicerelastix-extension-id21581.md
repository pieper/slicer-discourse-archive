<p>I am trying to deformably register a large amount of paris of CT lung images and output both deformed volume and transformation map using SlicerElastix extension without having to do it manually one-by-one. I understand that it can be done by the python interactor of the 3d slicer as mentioned in another thread: <a href="https://discourse.slicer.org/t/how-to-do-batch-registration/9633/7" class="inline-onebox">How to do batch registration? - #7 by Scorbinwen</a></p>
<p>I am a new learner in python and 3d slicer. Is there any tutorial or documents that I can follow to do this? Thank you.</p>
