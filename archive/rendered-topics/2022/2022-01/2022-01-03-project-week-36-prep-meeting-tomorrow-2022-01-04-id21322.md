<p>Dear members of the Project Week community, Happy 2022!</p>
<p>Please join us for our next Project Week 36 preparation meeting tomorrow, Jan 4th (10 am Boston time, EDT) on Zoom. This week, we will continue organizing the work in project teams. If you want to participate and do not yet have a project, we can help you join an existing one. If you have a project but are looking for team members, please come and present your ideas. If you have both, please join anyways to help us figure out how to best work and communicate during PW.</p>
<p>NOTE: for those who already have their projects figured out, please <a href="https://projectweek.na-mic.org/PW36_2022_Virtual/Projects/">create a project page on GitHub</a> as soon as possible.</p>
<p>You can join the meeting using the following link which will remain the same for all preparation meetings:</p>

<p>Project Week#36 will be held Jan 17-21, 2022, with most activities taking place <strong>on the internet</strong> . Please look here for additional details: <a href="https://projectweek.na-mic.org/PW36_2022_Virtual/" class="inline-onebox">Welcome to the web page for the 36th Project Week! | NA-MIC Project Weeks</a></p>
<p>Project Week 36 will adopt a format similar to Project Week 35 to maximize the accessibility of the workshop. As with Project Week 35, the workshop will mix demos and dissemination of Slicer based projects with hackathon-style working sessions.</p>
<p><em>Preparation</em> : To prepare, we will be holding weekly meetings at 10am on Tuesdays, starting <strong>Nov 9th, 2021</strong> and ending on December 8. Please join at <a href="https://etsmtl.zoom.us/j/86211702920?pwd=TEl0ZTFDam90WVN5bjZhR05kNVRVZz09">this link</a> if you have a project that you would like to present or work on during project week.</p>
<p><em>Background</em> : The Project Week is a week-long hackathon of hands on activity in which medical image computing researchers create solutions using the open source image computing platform, 3D Slicer, and VTK, ITK, CMake, and CDash libraries as well as OHIF, Cornerstone, dcmjs, vtkjs, itkjs, DICOMweb, Girder and related web technologies. Participants work collaboratively on solutions that lie at the interfaces of the fields of computer science, mechanical engineering, biomedical engineering, and medicine. In contrast to conferences and workshops where the primary focus is to report results, the objective of the ProjectWeek is to provide a venue for creators of medical image computing open-source software creators to collaboratively work.</p>
