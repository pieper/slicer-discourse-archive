<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I would like to have in my Slicer extensions repos a badge showing the build status and a GitHub Action that checks every day whether there are build errors on CDash.</p>
<p>Before I start working on it, has everyone done this before? If not, do you have any hints on how to check the build status programmatically?</p>

</ul>
<p>I am also sending an email to folks from the CDash team to learn what are the plans. Once I hear back, I will post an update here.</p>
<p>Thanks<br>
