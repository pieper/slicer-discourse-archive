<p>I created a new extension and created a <a href="https://github.com/Slicer/ExtensionsIndex/pull/1805" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">pull request</a> to the ExtensionsIndex. I completed the TODO list and I think it is ready to be merged.</p>
<p>I’d appreciate it if someone with write access could look at it and let me know if anything has to be changed.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
