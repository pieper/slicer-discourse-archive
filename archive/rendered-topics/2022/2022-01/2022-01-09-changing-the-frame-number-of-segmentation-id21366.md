<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Happy new year!</p>
<p>I have a segmentation done at an ROI from (lets’ say 50th-100th frame). I realized I have to do segmentation of entire frame from (0 to 100 anyways). But when I load my ROI-segmentation into the full folder DCM. The segmentation starts from 0 to 50th, instead of 50 to 100. Is there any solution to change the starting frame number of the segmentation file?</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for your assistance,</p>
