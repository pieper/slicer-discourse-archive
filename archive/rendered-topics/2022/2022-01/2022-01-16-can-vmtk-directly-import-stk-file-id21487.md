<p>Hi all, I’m trying to carry out an artery annotation task, to segment and annotate each artery name of an artery tree and hope to use the ‘vmtkbranchextractor’ command.<br>
However, my data all came in STL format, I’m wondering if VMTK can support the direct import of STL files? If not, since the VMTK extension for 3D-slicer doesn’t support brachextractor, is there any other way to proceed?</p>
