<p>Problem report for Slicer 4.13.0-2022-01-19 win-amd64: [please describe expected and actual behavior]<br>
Hy,<br>
when I open the install extensions tab, the slider at the bottom says 100% but the page appears white, I cannot see any extension. I tryed with different connections to the internet and different 3D slicer version (11 and 13) but I always got the same result. could you help me?</p>

<p>Hy,</p>
<p>not yet. I think it depends on my PC security settings that prevent access to some internet web pages.<br>
I am behind a work network controlled by system administrators with very strict rules…</p>
