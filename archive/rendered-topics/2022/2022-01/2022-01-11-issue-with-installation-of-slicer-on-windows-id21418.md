<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have had Slicer on my desktop (Windows 10) since August 2021 and initially I had no issue. I stopped working with it in past several months and now when I need it again, the software doesn’t open on my desktop. I have uninstalled and installed it but same issue. Has anyone encountered this issue? How can I fix it?</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

<p>See if any of these instructions (link below) help resolve your issue. Possibly your Slicer settings may have been corrupted. Let us know if you are successful with any of these!</p>
