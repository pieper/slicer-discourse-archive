<p>Hi !<br>
I would like to know how to replace the intensity values from the voxels of an image (nifti) by probability values (0-1) to generate a plot in colors. I have two files, the original image in nifti and the probabilities in a csv (rows = voxels, column = probabilities).</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
