<p>Operating system:Windows 11</p>
<p>I am doing a project on whether it is possible to automate the segmentation of bone from specifically MRI scans however I am new to the software. Can anyone point me in the right direction or at least let me know whether this is possible.</p>
<p>PS. Method must be for MRI not CT as the project is aimed at infants with bone deformities who would like to avoid the ionising X-rays from CT scanning, so please do not suggest using CT.</p>

<p>Hi, I am segmenting the pelvis and femora from MRIs and came across your post. Any luck with your project so far?</p>
