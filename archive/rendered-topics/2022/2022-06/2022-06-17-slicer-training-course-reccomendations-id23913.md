<p>The PerkLab bootcamp materials are great: <a href="https://github.com/PerkLab/PerkLabBootcamp" class="inline-onebox">GitHub - PerkLab/PerkLabBootcamp: Materials for the yearly PerkLab bootcamp course</a></p>

<p>The upcoming <a href="https://projectweek.na-mic.org/PW37_2022_Virtual/">Slicer Project Week</a> is also a good opportunity to learn about Slicer. Especially if you have a specific task you want to solve then you can write it up as a project and you can get help from experts to get started or if you get stuck.</p>
