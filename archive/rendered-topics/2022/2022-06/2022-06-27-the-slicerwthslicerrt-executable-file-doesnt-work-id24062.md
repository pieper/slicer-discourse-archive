<p>OP: Windows 10<br>
3D Slicer 4.13<br>
The build process of SlicerRT extension completed with no errors, but the executable file (SlicerWithSlicerRT) won’t open with me. would you tell me what could be wrong here?</p>

<p>I was able to get it to work by restarting my computer - maybe I originally had two many Slicer instances open before?</p>
