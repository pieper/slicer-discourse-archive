<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I’d like to save the content of the .3dus file (as with “3D ultrasound image” description in Slicer) to the .nrrd and .seq.nrrd files, by using Slicer functionality but without opening the Slicer.exe window. Can it be done using the PythonSlicer.exe? If so, what are the settings for this operation?</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
