<p>In another forum using discourse, I saw that the community established a category/channel called Showroom where they are encouraged to post the pictures of what they have done with the software. I thought that might be a good addition to our forum as well.</p>
<p>We have the announcements, but that’s not quite for that…</p>

<p>We have the <a href="https://discourse.slicer.org/c/community/success-stories/29" class="inline-onebox">Success stories - 3D Slicer Community</a> category for that, but maybe that puts the bar a bit too high. <code>Showroom</code> could be a bit more welcoming - it could invite more people to post there, even if it was too early to call something a <code>Success story</code>.</p>
<p>I would support the idea to rename the <code>Success stories</code> category to <code>Showroom</code>.</p>

<p>Yes, I was thinking success story is a high bar fort some things. Slicer 3 were had a script to post the current screen to the visual blog. We could add a feature like that to the screen capture module to post to the gallery.</p>

<p>You can right-click on a view to copy to the clipboard and paste that directly into Slicer forum posts. I think all operating systems has now built-in screen snipping tools that allow copying any screen region to the clipboard. I’m not sure if we can make this much simpler.</p>

<p>It’s more about reminding/encouraging people to do it when they have Ann images they like and are able to share.</p>

<p>Encouraging users to post more and making it easier is great. Thanks for reaching out.</p>

<p>In that community, do you have more details on how users are suggested  &amp; guided to post more ?  (reminded on twitter, call-out on site, … ?)</p>
