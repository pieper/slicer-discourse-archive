<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I remember I accidently stumbled on Slicer based application that was running on WEB and it used to have dark style with beatiful blue colors.<br>
I think it used something different from Qt, probably C# or javascript.</p>
<p>I can’t find it anymore (it seems I didn’t make a bookmark).</p>
<p>If somebody knows what I’m looking for please share a link <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>

<p>I think you can use Slicer with a color pallet with that. Setting a qstylesheet.<br>
You can select a gamma of rgb for the miniwidgets</p>
<p>Hope it helps</p>
