<p>I m a beginner in 3d slicer. I m trying to create a model of the lumbar spine from dicom data (with cancellous bone, cortical shell, intervertabral disc and interbody cage) but i didn t succeed. Anyone can help ?<br>
Thanks</p>

<p>This is a common segmentation task and many groups have worked on it and achieved decent results recently with deep-learning based methods. I would suggest to contact <a class="mention" href="/u/Ron">@Ron</a> to get more information about the current status. You can probably also learn about spine segmentation projects at the upcoming <a href="https://projectweek.na-mic.org/PW37_2022_Virtual/">Slicer Project Week</a> (starting on Monday).</p>
