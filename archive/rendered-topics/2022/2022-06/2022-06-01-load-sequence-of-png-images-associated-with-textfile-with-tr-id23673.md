<p>Hello!</p>
<p>I am new to 3D Slicer. I have PNG images names 0.png, 1.png, etc. representing ultrasound frames taken at 100fps. For each image, there is a corresponding line in a textfile in the form (framenumber,timestamp,translation,quaternion). I would like to compile this sequence of images with their positions and rotations into a 3D volume, interpolating missing voxels. How can I do this in 3D Slicer?</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>
