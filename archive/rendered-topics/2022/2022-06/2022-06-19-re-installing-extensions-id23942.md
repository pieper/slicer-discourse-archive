<p>I have to re-install extensions each time I install a new version of slicer,</p>
<p>is there a faster or alternative way instead of going to the extensions manager and doing it all over?</p>
<p>thanks</p>

<p>Yes!</p>
<p>A couple of days ago we introduced the new Extensions Manager, which can fully automatically check for extension updates and install them automatically in Slicer Stable Releases. We plan to add this feature to the upcoming Slicer-5.0.3 patch release within a few weeks.</p>
<p>Since there are no extension updates for Slicer Preview Releases (each day is a new, independent release), you cannot take advantage of automatic updates there. But the new bookmark feature in the Extensions Manager allows you to reinstall all your favorite extension with just 3 clicks (open Extensions Manager, click “Install bookmarked”, click Restart). Give it a try and let us know how well it works for you.</p>
