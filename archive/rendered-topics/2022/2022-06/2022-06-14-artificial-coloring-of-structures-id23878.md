<p>I want to be able to color different segments different colors. They do not need to be realistic. I am working with Anatomy students and want to be able to “turn on” highlighted color so the students can easily see the relationship and orientation of structures in context of the rest body. My scans are of the cadavers that they will be directing and do not have added contrast.</p>

    Hello, I need to correct some manual segmentations I had received for the project I am working on as part of my PhD thesis. The problem is that I have a volume file and a segmentation file and the segmentation file has 200 segmented regions in it. And beyond that I have to do this for more images. I want to scan each one and evaluate the segmentation. I believe that it would be very helpful to click on each of the segmented region and the region to be highlighted in the slices of the 3d image.
