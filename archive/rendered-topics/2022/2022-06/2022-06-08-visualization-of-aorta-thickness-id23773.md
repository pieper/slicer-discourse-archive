<p>I need to segment the aortic wall. We are working with CT images. Is there a filter that I can apply to the images to enhance the CT images to show the vasculature? I just need some recommendations that way I don’t have to sort through 100+ filters. Also, I have been looking for filters and applying them one by one. Is the only way to reverse the filters is to close without saving and open the images again?</p>

<p>You can use simple filters module. So you can test arpund.</p>
<p>I would start by ‘vesselness filters’</p>
<p>There is no need to open and reopen the file when ypu want a new result just change thw nodes the filter gives away after processing</p>
