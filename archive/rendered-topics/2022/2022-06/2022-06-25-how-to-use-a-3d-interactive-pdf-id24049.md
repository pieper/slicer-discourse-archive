<p>I am trying to load data I found that is a VRML file embedded into an interactive PDF. I am trying to view this data in Slicer but am unsure how to do so because I cannot load a PDF and I don’t know how to access the VRML file directly. Any help is appreciated <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>

<p>3D PDF is a terrible, old, and neglected file format with no openly available tools to create or read them. I’m afraid you need to contact those who created the file and ask for the content in a more accessible file format, such as DICOM or any other research file formats (see list of supported file formats <a href="https://slicer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/data_loading_and_saving.html#supported-data-formats">here</a>).</p>
