<p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>I have been doing segmentations for months on Slicer.<br>
I now have a problem. When I try to<br>
open an old file, slicer doesn’t load automatically everything inside it. When I double click on the scene.mml file, slicer opens but it’s empty. I have to load manually all the .nrrd files.<br>
I never had this problem before.</p>
<p>Do you how to get rid of this problem?</p>
<p>Thank you</p>
<p>Greg</p>

<p>It should be possible to load scenes into Slicer-5 that were created with Slicer-4. That said, it is possible that there are some incompatibility issues that need to be fixed. If you can share a scene that reproduces the issue (use public or anonymized data) then we can look into it.</p>
