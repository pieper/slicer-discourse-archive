<p>I have Slicer-4.8.0-win-amd64 on a windows 10 system. I can no longer interface the extension-manager. I have a very specific hierarchy design in a human trial and need to keep version 4.8.0 running on a new computer but I can not get Sequences or SlicerIGT extensions for some reason. Are these extensions available still for Slicer-4.8.0 via hard disk?</p>
<p>The expertise in my group is no longer avialble to redesgikn the hierarchy in the newest version of 3D slicer.</p>

<p>See instructions how to download old releases of Slicer and extensions for it <a href="https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/Nightly/FAQ/General#Where_can_I_download_older_release_of_Slicer_.3F">here</a>. You can install a downloaded extension package by selecting <code>Install from File</code> from the tools menu in the Extensions Manager.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/jcfr">@jcfr</a> As far as I remember, you implemented a backward compatibility layer in the new extensions server. Isn’t it supposed to make extensions manager work in Slicer-4.8?</p>
