<p>I am following the tutorial of <a href="http://www.vmtk.org/tutorials/MappingAndPatching.html" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">MappingAndPatching</a>.</p>
<p>After executing the commands for the following operations</p>
<h3><a name="p-80103-centerlines-extraction-and-branch-splitting-1" class="anchor" href="#p-80103-centerlines-extraction-and-branch-splitting-1" aria-label="Heading link"></a>Centerlines extraction and branch splitting</h3>
<h3><a name="p-80103-bifurcation-reference-systems-2" class="anchor" href="#p-80103-bifurcation-reference-systems-2" aria-label="Heading link"></a>Bifurcation reference systems</h3>
<h3><a name="p-80103-surface-splitting-3" class="anchor" href="#p-80103-surface-splitting-3" aria-label="Heading link"></a>Surface splitting</h3>
<p>When I check out the resulting groups with</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">vmtksurfaceviewer -ifile "C:\\Users\\W10\\Desktop\\dicom\\trachea_clipped.vtp" -array GroupIds
</code></pre>
<p>there is a hole at the intersection of the groups. I tried increasing surface mesh resolution and also smoothing but the hole always there.</p>
<p>I would like to upload the vtp file but uploader does not let me due to extension.</p>

<p>You can upload your dataset somewhere (onedrive, dropbox, google drive, etc.) and post the link here.</p>
