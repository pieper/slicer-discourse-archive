<p>Hi everyone!<br>
In our project we work with low-contrasted CT scans, and manual segmentación. So we need often switch segment visibility.</p>
<p>Does exist Hotkey to on/off segment visibility, or the way to add this hotkeys fo our segmentation team?</p>
<p>Best regards!</p>

<p>Common keyboard shortcuts are listed <a href="https://slicer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/user_interface.html#slice-views">here</a>. According to this, <kbd>g</kbd> key toggles segmentation visibility.</p>
<p>Segment Editor shortcuts are listed <a href="https://slicer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/modules/segmenteditor.html#keyboard-shortcuts">here</a>.</p>
<p>You can also add any keyboard shortcut for any operation in Slicer. See examples in the <a href="https://slicer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer_guide/script_repository.html#keyboard-shortcuts-and-mouse-gestures">script repository</a>. If you have trouble figuring out how to perform the operation that you want to perform with the shortcut then have a look at other examples in the script repository or ask us here.</p>
