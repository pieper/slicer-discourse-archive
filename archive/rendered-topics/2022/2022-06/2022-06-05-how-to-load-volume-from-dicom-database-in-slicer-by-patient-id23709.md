<p>在我的DICOM database中, 有30多病人, 我想通过patient Name导入dcm,我该怎么做呢?<br>
另外, 我还想对做过的病人在DICOM database中做个标记比如[v]/<span class="chcklst-box fa fa-square-o fa-fw"></span>等, 能实现吗?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In my DICOM database, there are more than 30 patients, I want to load dcm by patient Name, how can I do it?<br>
In addition, I also want to mark the patients who have done it in the DICOM database, such as <span class="chcklst-box checked fa fa-check-square-o fa-fw"></span> or <span class="chcklst-box fa fa-square-o fa-fw"></span> etc. Can this be achieved?</p>
