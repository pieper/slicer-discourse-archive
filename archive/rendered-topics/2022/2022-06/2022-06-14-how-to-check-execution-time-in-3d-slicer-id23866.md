<p>You can get statistics about user activity in Slicer using <code>User Statistics</code> module in the Sandbox extension:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This module measures user statistics and stores them in a table.<br>
Some of the statistics that are measured are active module, active segment editor effect, selected segment, duration, application status (active, wait, idle), etc.</p>
