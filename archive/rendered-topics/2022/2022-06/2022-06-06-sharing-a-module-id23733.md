<p>Hi, I’m trying to locally share a module that I have written (in python) to another PC I installed Slicer on.<br>
I was wondering is it possible to just copy the module folder to another computer and add the module folder address to “Additional Module Paths”? I checked and the module doesn’t pop up in the module search box, or if it pops up, the “switch to module” button is disabled.<br>
What would be the simple solution?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance<br>
Best,<br>
Saeed</p>

<p>Yes, if it’s pure python just copy the folder to the other computer.  You can add the path in the Modules section of the Application Settings dialog.  If it doesn’t load check the error log.</p>
