<p>I am a resident physician (MD) from the University of Toronto passionate about medical imaging, and I can offer freelance 3D slicer modelling of structures within the human body. If your organization is in need of an MD for medical guidance concerning your 3D slicer project, I am also glad to help.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Hi <a class="mention" href="/u/weitingmd">@WeitingMD</a> ,<br>
I am a university professor and currently supervising a group of UG students interested in segmenting the jaws. They need to do the seg themselves in order for the project to acceptable. Would you be interested in providing a tutorial?</p>
