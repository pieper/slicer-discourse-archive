<p>I have just downloaded the 5.0.2 version of 3D Slicer on my Macbook and it keeps malfunctioning. Whenever I try to use the scissor tool in Segment Editor, the application crashes after a few minutes and erases all of my progress. I just downloaded the app so there is no way that I have run out of memory storage already. Just wondering if there is a way to solve this issue?<br>

<p>The scissors work for me on 5.0.2 on mac.  Are you using a particularly big dataset?  Does it work with sample data?  If your data is big you can try either downsampling or cropping just the area of interest.</p>

<p>the problem is that i can appload files and data to the program, but after sometime it just crushes and stops working</p>
