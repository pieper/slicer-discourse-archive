<p>Hello，I’m trying to do some deep learning quest on 3d reconstruction from lung x-rays (CT’s DRR).  I want to take some features from DRR and use this to transform a initial template lung mesh to the ground-truth mesh, which needs a specific vertex number mesh model and a relation between the vertex and the DRR.<br>
Here are my questions about data preparation:</p>
<ol>
<li>Can I get a specific vertex number surface model from a lung CT and its segmentation?(Now I can only export a surface model to STL or OBJ which has a random vertex number).</li>
<li>I know that DRR is a synthetic x-ray for a CT. Can I get a DRR in slicer?</li>
<li>If I get a DRR and the specific vertex number surface model, is there any way I can map the vertex of the model onto a DRR pixel?</li>
<li>For the initial lung template mesh, can I get a mean shape mesh from different lung CTs?</li>
</ol>
<p>Sorry for my stupid questions, I’m really poor in medical knowledge.</p>
