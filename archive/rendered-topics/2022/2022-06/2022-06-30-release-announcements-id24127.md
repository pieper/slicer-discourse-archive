<p>Hi,<br>
I’m quite new to this community, and I thought that by checking the website from time to time, I could find out when releases are made. But as it happened, 5.0 was released, and even 5.0.1 and 5.0.2, apparently with no announcement on the website.<br>
At the time of this writing, the <a href="https://slicer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">current documentation</a> still says it is “work in progress, in preparation for the new Slicer-5.0 release”; the only change in the website, AFAICT, is in the “downloads” page, and the last message in the <a href="https://discourse.slicer.org/c/announcements/release-notes/18">Forum “Release Notes” category</a> is three years old, referring to Slicer 4.10.2. Releases are named <a href="https://github.com/Slicer/Slicer/wiki/Release-Details" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">in the Github Wiki</a>, but there’s not much info there…</p>
<p>Is there a place I’ve missed, where later releases are announced with the details of major changes?</p>

<p>Thanks for checking in - yes, the new Slicer 5 binaries are available now and generally work great but they are still being patched here and there as issues come to light.  There is a good draft of the release announcement but it hasn’t gone out yet.  Bear with us - it’s a small team working on releases in parallel with lots of other work so sometimes getting all the pieces done takes time.</p>
<p>There’s <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1CL8Sr0sONMk7v_0fmxQ5PlhNyR8riTRPisTQ2jEnj6Q/edit#slide=id.p">a presentation</a> about the status from the recent <a href="https://projectweek.na-mic.org/PW37_2022_Virtual/">Project Week 37</a>.</p>
