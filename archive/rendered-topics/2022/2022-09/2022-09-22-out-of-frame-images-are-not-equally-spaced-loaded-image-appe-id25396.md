<p>Hi I am getting the following error when uploading the DICOM  images.<br>
3: 1905813R [Scalar Volume]: Images are not equally spaced (a difference of -1 vs 2 in spacings was detected).  If loaded image appears distorted, enable ‘Acquisition geometry regularization’ in Application settings / DICOM / DICOMScalarVolumePlugin. Please use caution.</p>
<p>It also shows that it is out of frame in segment editor.</p>
<p>How can I fix this issue pls?</p>
