<p>Hi:</p>
<p>I installed Slicer version 5.1.0 revision 31159 in windows 10. But I couldn’t installed SlicerVMTK extension. Why?</p>
<p>Sincerely</p>

<p>Thanks for reporting.  Apparently there <a href="https://slicer.cdash.org/viewBuildError.php?buildid=2811905">are some build errors</a> with the latest ITK that need to be sorted out.  Hopefully it will be resolved in the next few days.</p>

<p>The build error is fixed now, VMTK extension should be available again in the Slicer Preview Release from tomorrow.</p>
