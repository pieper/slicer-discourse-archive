<p>Hello, I’m new to Slicer and would like to create and extension that contains some custome modules. When I created the extension through the extension wizard a CMakeLists.txt was automatically created. This file contains a URL to a description page of my extension on Slice Documentation (no content on the page).</p>
<p>My extension is created locally right? As my understanding to make it public I have to submit it to the Slicer Extensions Index.</p>
<p>I will consider sharing when my code is ready:)</p>

<p>Yes your understanding is correct. Those URLs are just part of the template. Nothing has been created remotely when you used the extension wizard.</p>
