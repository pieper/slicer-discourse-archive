<p>Hi!<br>
Being new to the slicer community, I was thinking of going through the common development setup along with the specific tools used to check the code quality and also adhere to the coding conventions currently being followed in the community.</p>
<p>I tried searching FAQ docs but didn’t find anything related to coding conventions. If that isn’t documented yet, perhaps you can just mention what your current development setup looks like as well as the coding conventions and I’ll explore more in that direction.</p>

<p>Check out the developer guide as I believe this covers many of the topics you are asking about.</p>
