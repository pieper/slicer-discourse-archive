<p>I’m looking for segmentation of teeth individually from ct scan and my goal is to seperate teeth, pdl ,dentin ,cementum ,enamel of each teeth. Can anyone help me with this and I’m planning to import into fusion 360 or blender for my research purpose?</p>

<p>There is a publication that details steps in Segment Editor to achieve this. I recently answered the same question here on the forum and posted the link. If you search for it I’m sure you’ll find it.</p>
