<p>Currently, the default color for all models in Slicer is yellow. I wanted to implement a feature that would give different types of models different default colors, like Qt::blue for bones and Qt::red for blood vessels. Now the question is, how do I know what type of models to use for adding and where should I change their default colors?</p>

<p>How do you know if your model is bone or blood? From the name of the files you load them from?</p>

<p>Yeah, I’m doing it by file name now</p>
