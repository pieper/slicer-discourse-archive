<p>I had developed an CLI, which finally outputs a point list into a fcsv file.  The xml of CLI is written like “&lt;pointfile fileExtensions=”.fcsv" coordinateSystem=“lps”&gt;&lt;name&gt;node&lt;/name&gt;&lt;label&gt;points&lt;/label&gt;&lt;longflag&gt;file&lt;/longflag&gt;&lt;channel&gt;output&lt;/channel&gt;&lt;/pointfile&gt;"</p>
<p>However, Slicer cannot load it automatically and report following errors:<br>
"vtkMRMLMarkupsJsonStorageNode::ReadDataInternal:Error parsing the file’/tmp/Slicer-deep/HJEFE_vtkMRMLMarkupsFiducialNodeB.fcsv</p>
<p>vtkMRMLStorageNode::ReadData:Failed to read node from file name '/tmp/Slicer-deep/HJEFE_vtkMRMLMarkupsFiducialNodeB.fcsv"</p>
<p>Any suggestion is welcome. Thanks!</p>

<p>See an example of a CLI module producing markup file as output <a href="https://github.com/Slicer/Slicer/blob/20830465655c3f07e40bf569b619ac14ae448f02/Modules/CLI/ExecutionModelTour/ExecutionModelTour.cxx#L146-L154">here</a>. I would recommend to use .mrk.json format instead of the legacy .fcsv file, as the json file format is much more robust and flexible.</p>
