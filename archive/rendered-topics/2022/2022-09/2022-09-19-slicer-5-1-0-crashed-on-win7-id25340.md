<p>Microsoft has stopped providing essential security updates year for Windows 7 years ago and it is no longer allowed to be used at most places. We don’t test current Slicer versions with this discontinued Windows version and apparently, they are not compatible anymore. See supported operating systems <a href="https://slicer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/getting_started.html#system-requirements">here</a>.</p>
<p>You can retrieve older Slicer-4.x versions, which should still work on Windows 7, but of course I would strongly recommend to update your computer and use the current Slicer version.</p>
