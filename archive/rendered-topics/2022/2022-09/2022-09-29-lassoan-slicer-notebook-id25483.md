<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have been using “lassoan/slicer-notebook” image to run Slicer Jupyter in a local Docker container. However, this image does not contain many extensions and I had to install SlicerIGT for every session.</p>
<p>Here is my request: could you please help with a code to change the container image set-up to allow automatic installation of the SlicerIGT extension?  I appreciate that “stevepieper/slicer” Docker image contains examples of .py and Dockerfile for extension installations. However, my computer science knowledge is not sufficient to place these examples correctly.</p>
<p>Thank you very much in advance.</p>
