<p>Hello Andras and Community,</p>
<p>I have the following question: is it possible to create a Point List by placing multiple Points and then to create a Closed Curve between those points?</p>
<p>(the way I go around it at the moment is to place the Points as a Point List and then activate Closed Curve and click on every single Point manually to create the Closed Curve; my goal is to somehow import the already existing Points in the Closed Curve)</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

<p>You can copy-paste control points between markups in the control points table in Markups module.</p>
<p>Instead of using a point list and then copying the points to the curve, why don’t you place closed curve control points directly?</p>
