<p>Hello, I am running 5.0.3 r30893 / 7ea0f43  and I want the Lights module that comes with the Sandbox extension.  I have installed the Sandbox extension.  How can I invoke the lights module?  It doesn’t appear in my Modules dropdown.   I’m on a Windows 10 Pro system.</p>
<p>Thanks !</p>

<p>I just tested on linux with the current 5.0.3 release and after installing the Sandbox extension the Lights module is in the Utilities submenu (or you can search for it with Control-F).</p>

<p>Got it!  I’m new enough to the tool to not realize there are modules not linked in the dropdown menu, now I know that I can search for modules.  Thanks!</p>
