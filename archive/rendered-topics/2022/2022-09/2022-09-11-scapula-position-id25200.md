<p>Hi, I’m trying to find the position of the scapula in CT scans, like the one described here:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1058274619302319?casa_token=HGF5fyzpn4IAAAAA:wyyUE96Jo_t-EEdDQjFdQtjmtOFOnGHd58lwOBnpfapycvovp702mzFGcyktPidTn7akTEDQf1o#" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Three-dimensional clavicle displacement analysis and its effect on scapular position in acute clavicle midshaft fracture - ScienceDirect</a>!</p>
<p>However I could not get any tangible measurements. I tried to use the same methodology as the the article above but I failed to create a plane using three points and I’m rather stuck now.</p>

<p>Please go to the markups module, click on create a plane but don’t click on a view yet, stay on the side panel. Then, there is option to create the plane from 3 points and other configurations. Now you can go to the 3D or sliceView and create your plane from 3 points</p>

<p>Didn’t know it was such a simple solution. Thank you so much.<br>
You are the best.</p>
