<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I’m interested in finding a way to compare the volume distribution of the brain for patients with various conditions.</p>
<p>My plan is to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Obtain CT heads</li>
<li>Strip the skull</li>
<li>Segment the brain</li>
<li>Dynamically visualize the structural differences between brains</li>
</ol>
<p>One idea is to create a heatmap of the brain for each patient demonstrating the volume distribution relative to a given point, like the centroid. Another option could be to superimpose two brain segments atop another.</p>
<p>Would anyone have advice for how to go about this in a visually appealing and seamless way?</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>
