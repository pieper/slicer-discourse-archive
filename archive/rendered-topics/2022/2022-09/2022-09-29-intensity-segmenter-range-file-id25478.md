<p>Hello, I am trying to apply the Range file ( .txt file) in the Intensity Segmenter module, but it is not charging or segmenting. I used this range file when using the Slicer 4.0, now, I only have the newest version 5.0.<br>
Any suggestion on where to get a range file for the bone that works in the Slicer 5.0? Or maybe a step-by-step suggestion for applying the range file in Slicer 5.0?</p>

<p>It looks like <a href="https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/Nightly/Extensions/IntensitySegmenter">that module</a> hasn’t been kept up to date with the latest Slicer, but it looks like you can do the same thing with the Threshold effect in the Segment Editor by typing in the values manually.</p>
