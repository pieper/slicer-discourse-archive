<p>How do you get Slicer to include custom modules in the bundle</p>

<p>Probably the best solution is to use the Custom Application Template. See <a href="https://slicer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer_guide/extensions.html#how-to-build-a-custom-slicer-package-with-additional-extensions-bundled">this section of the developer documentation</a>.</p>
