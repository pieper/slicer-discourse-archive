<p>Hi,</p>
<p>In my slicer module, I have a text box for entering the patient’s serial number. I wanted to know how I could save this value and reload it as I reload the slicer scene on starting it? Similar to the way we can reload the previously saved fiducial points, as they are saved in json etc.</p>

<p>you can write a python script using a button save and load the parameter into a file.</p>
