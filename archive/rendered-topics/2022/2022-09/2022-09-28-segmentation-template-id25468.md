<p>Hi,<br>
I would appreciate any tips on setting up a template (segmentations, segments and colors)  for use on multiple patient studies (nii).  This would guarantee identical segmentation and segment names and colors for each study.</p>
<p>I’m aware of pipelines, but all I need is a segmentation template.  Then nii files can be imported and segmentation performed manually.</p>
<p>It seems that segments cannot be added to a segmentation without a Master Volume.<br>
I tried creating a scene and then deleting image data to create a template, but there were some bugs.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance,<br>
Jim</p>
