<p>Dear all,<br>
I am fairly new to 3D Slicer so I am still figuring things out, but I hope you can help me. I have some data consisting of individual PET and CT scans. On the PET scans, I segmentated a lesion using PET-IndiC, and saved them as <strong>nrrd</strong>-files. Now, I want to apply the same segmentation (basically copy) onto the CT-scans. However, these CT-scans have a different FOV, and thus do not lead to the same segmentation. I want to use both segmentation for radiomics feature extraction, can someone help me out <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"> ? Thanks in advance!</p>
