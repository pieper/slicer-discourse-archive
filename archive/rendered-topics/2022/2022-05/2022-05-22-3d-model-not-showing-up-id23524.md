<p>Hello, I’m trying to do some experiments with 3D Slicer, but the 3d model doesn’t show up no matter what I do (I tried to adjust the fov and under “volume rendering” section I only have the CT object, not the 3d one). By the way, right now I’m trying the sample data so this situation is really strange.<br>
Thank you.</p>

<p>Can you be more specific about what Slicer version and what computer platform you are using?  To debug, I suggest starting with one of the tutorials and go step by step and then report when something doesn’t work as shown in the tutorial.</p>

<p>Do you mean you are loading an STL, OBJ, PLY, VTP, VTU, or VTK file as a <code>Model</code> and nothing appears in the 3D view?</p>
<p>Does the model appear if you click in the 3D view and hit the <kbd>r</kbd> key (to reset the zoom factor and field of view)?</p>
