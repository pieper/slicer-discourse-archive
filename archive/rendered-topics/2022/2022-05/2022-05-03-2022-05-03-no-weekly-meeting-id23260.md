<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>There will be no developer meeting today, as we will be having the first project week Prep meeting.  Scheduling of the developer meeting during the Project Week Prep period will be discussed at that time.</p>
<p>See post:. <a href="https://discourse.slicer.org/t/project-week-prep-meeting-starts-today/23259" class="inline-onebox">Project Week Prep meeting starts today!</a></p>
