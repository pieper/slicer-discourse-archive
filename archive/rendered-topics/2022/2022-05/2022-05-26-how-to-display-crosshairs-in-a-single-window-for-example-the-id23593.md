<p>If you show a single slice then there are no slice intersections to display. However, you can still display the crosshair.</p>

<p>I’m sorry I didn’t describe it clearly.</p>
<p>First, open the CT image, and 4 views will appear, with crosshairs.</p>
<p>Secondly, I maximize one of them, such as the R view, and the cross hairs will disappear.</p>
<p>To put it simply, I just hope that the crosshairs will still exist when the view is maximized.</p>
<p>Looking forward to your reply</p>

<p>Crosshair and slice intersections are two different things. Slice intersections will not appear if you only have one slice view in the view layout. If you enable crosshair display, it will be always visible in the slice and 3D views, regardless of what layout you use.</p>
