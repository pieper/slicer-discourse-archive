<p>Considering that several members of the community are attending the <a href="https://github.com/PerkLab/PerkLabBootcamp#program">global workshop on Sustainable Development in Computer-Assisted Interventions and Diagnosis</a>, both the project week preparation call and the slicer developer hangout have been cancelled.</p>
