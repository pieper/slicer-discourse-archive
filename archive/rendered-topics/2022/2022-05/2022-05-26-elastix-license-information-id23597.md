<p><a href="https://github.com/SuperElastix/elastix/blob/develop/LICENSE">Elastix uses Apache license</a>. This means that - similarly to Slicer - you are free to use and modify Elastix any way you want. You can even modify the source code and create a closed-source commercial software from it without asking permission or telling it to anyone.</p>
