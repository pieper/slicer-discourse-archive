<p>When I use slicercustomapptemplate customization program, I have several questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>What preparations do I need to make before all builds? For example, do I need to download cmake, vs2017 and install QT (I use the python compiler used by Python Programming Language).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I think the forum said that GTI bash needs to be installed. Is this necessary</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>3、pip install cookiecutter jinja2-github</p>
<p>cookiecutter gh:KitwareMedical/SlicerCustomAppTemplate</p>
<p>Where do I need to run this paragraph? I try to run it in gitbash and CONDA training environment, but they all report errors</p>

<p>Discourse does not let me copy-paste the same answer, so please see my answer to the same question you asked in a different topic: <a href="https://discourse.slicer.org/t/creating-a-custom-3d-slicer/21245/21" class="inline-onebox">Creating a custom 3D Slicer - #21 by cpinter</a></p>
<p>I’d encourage you to ask a question only once - we will see it just as well. Thank you.</p>
