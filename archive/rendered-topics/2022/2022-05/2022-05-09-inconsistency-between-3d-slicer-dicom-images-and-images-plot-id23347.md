<p>Slicer version: 4.13.0<br>
I’m performing semantic segmentation of Left Ventricle through 3D slicer and Google Colab.<br>
I want to create my dataset of images and masks. In order to create my images dataset I loaded the .dcm files of each patient on colab. I expected an exact reproduction between the images on 3D slicer and the images plotted on python . I can’t understand why .<br>
thank you in advance</p>
