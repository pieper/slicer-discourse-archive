<p>Hello,</p>
<p>We have two different models of Phillips ultrasound machines in our hospital. The EPIQ 7W for OB and the 7C for cardiology.</p>
<p>We have been using the 7W to export volumes of fetal pathology to reconstruct using 3D Slicer and 3D print models for surgical planning.</p>
<p>However, when we try exporting from the 7C machine, following the same steps, we only get still images of the 3D volume/render.</p>
<p>Does anyone have experience using the Phillips EPIQ 7C machines to export volumes that can be read in Slicer?</p>
