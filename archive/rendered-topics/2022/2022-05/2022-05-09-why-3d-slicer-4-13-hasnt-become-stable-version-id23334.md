<p>Recently, Slicer 5.1.0 is shown as preview release in <a href="https://download.slicer.org/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://download.slicer.org/</a></p>
<p>However, I expected that 3D Slicer 4.13 would now become the stable release replacing 4.11.20210226.</p>
<p>When and what version is going to be the next stable release? Will 4.13 ever be the stable release or will it directly be 5.1.0?</p>

<p>Slicer 5.0 is being released. The packages are not yet generated, that’s why the stable in the download page shows the old one. Please hang on a day or two more. In the meantime see progress here <a href="https://github.com/Slicer/Slicer/issues/6337" class="inline-onebox">Release Slicer v5.0 · Issue #6337 · Slicer/Slicer · GitHub</a></p>
