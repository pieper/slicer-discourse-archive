<p>I have the MPRAGE volume and its segmentation done with Freesurfer. What is a good way to plan the SEEG electrode position using 3DSlicer? Any module or extension?</p>

<p>Hello Gonzalo,</p>
<p>You may refer to <a href="https://discourse.slicer.org/t/trajectory-calculation-for-stereotaxic-frames/13963/25">Trajectory calculation for stereotaxic frames - Support - 3D Slicer Community</a> this thread.</p>

<p>And, your extension has different types of electrodes to do the simulation?</p>

<p>It’s not my extension, but that extension has compatibility with all types of frames, you can put your questions in the same thread.</p>
<p>Thank you<br>
Nayan</p>
