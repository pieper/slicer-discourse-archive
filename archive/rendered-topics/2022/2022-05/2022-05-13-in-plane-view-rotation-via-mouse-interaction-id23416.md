<p>To my knowledge, a view may only be translated or zoomed via mouse interaction. Would it make sense to enable view rotation, e.g. about the view’s center?</p>
<p>Combined with the great addition of the <a href="https://discourse.slicer.org/t/interactive-slice-intersections/21677">interactive slice intersection</a>, this would deliver a truly excellent UX for exploratory interaction with 3D data, for example.</p>
<p>While I recognize similar functionality is provided by the reformat module, the UX is challenging because it does not seem to play nicely with interactive slice intersection. For example, it’s far too easy to obtain views that are no longer mutually orthogonal. Returning to a default configuration requires significant interaction (unlink views, reset each view manually, re-link views).</p>
