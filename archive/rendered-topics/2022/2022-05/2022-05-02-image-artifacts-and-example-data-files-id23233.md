<p>For my master thesis I am researching ways to reduce image artifacts in direct volume rendering.</p>
<p>Perhaps you know some conventional approaches that are used in slicing.</p>
<p>Furthermore I am searching some example data sets that illustrate the image artifacts particularly well.</p>
<p>I would be happy if you could help me with this problem too.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

<p>Hi -</p>
<p>If you search for volume rendering on this forum you will find lots of questions to give you ideas of where people have troubles.  I strongly suggest you pick a specific problem to focus your work rather than starting with a general problem of volume rendering.  Examples could be cone beam CT for dental planning or improving vessel visualization in the brain in MRA datasets.  Perhaps someone here who has a particular use case can give you a problem to work on.</p>
