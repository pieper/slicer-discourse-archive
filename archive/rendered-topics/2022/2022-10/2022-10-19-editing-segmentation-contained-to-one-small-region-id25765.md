<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am trying to edit a segmentation in the segmentation editor. I am able to edit the segmentation to some extent, but any painting or drawing is only allowed in a small rectangle around the original segmentations. Any addition (say I wanted to draw something on the far left side of the image) does not work, has anyone encountered this before?</p>

<p>This section in the documentation should help: <a href="https://slicer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/modules/segmenteditor.html#cannot-paint-outside-some-boundaries" class="inline-onebox">Segment editor — 3D Slicer documentation</a></p>
