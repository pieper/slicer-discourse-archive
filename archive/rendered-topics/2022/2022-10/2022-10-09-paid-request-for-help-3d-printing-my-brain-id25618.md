<p>Hi Guys,</p>
<p>I was made aware of 3D slicer for my mechanical engineering thesis: Modelling of geometrically complex parts of the anatomy.</p>
<p>However, that was many moons ago now, so would need to re skill.</p>
<p>In the mean time, I had a CT scan taken of my brain to asses a concussion I received boxing. I was wondering if anyone could covert the CT image into a 3D model so that I can 3D print a copy of my own brain !</p>
<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated and of course, I would be happy to pay for service</p>
<p>Kind Regards,</p>
<p>John</p>

<p>you can take a T1 mri scan first<br>
then use the extension HDBrainExtraction to Extract your whole brain model<br>
use extension SlicerFab to 3DPrint or export your brain model to .stl file and use third-party software to 3DPrint</p>

<p>Yes, its easy to do if you share the DICOM-data. We do the workflow in orthopaedic animal healthcare every day. We support you for free as well</p>
