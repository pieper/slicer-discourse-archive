<p>Dear All,</p>
<p>I started work on [SlicerSegmentationRecipes/VesselSegmentationBySubtraction at master · lassoan/SlicerSegmentationRecipes · GitHub]<br>
(<a href="https://github.com/lassoan/SlicerSegmentationRecipes/tree/master/VesselSegmentationBySubtraction" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">SlicerSegmentationRecipes/VesselSegmentationBySubtraction at master · lassoan/SlicerSegmentationRecipes · GitHub</a>)</p>
<p>I tried to run the Elastix module, but I keep getting the same error :<br>
Error: Command ‘elastix’ returned non-zero exit status 4294967294.<br>
It occurs in both the Stable(5.0.3) and the Preview Release.<br>
Do you have any solution for it?</p>
<p>Thank You in advance,</p>
<p>Oliver Faris Halaseh</p>

<p>Dear All,</p>
<p>I couldn’t solve the problem on Windows, but it worked perfectly on macOS.</p>
