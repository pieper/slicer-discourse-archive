<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>I’m new using 3dslicer, and I wonder if I can work in python, put in same folder of the file some extensions and call them like functions. Its possible that?</p>
<p>I need to obtain the center line of a volume and I had success using the extension. I have other process that I already run in my python file, so I would like to integrate this last process to the others in my python environment.</p>
<p>Thanks!<br>
Lucas.</p>

<p>Hey <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/wave.png?v=12" title=":wave:" class="emoji" alt=":wave:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"><br>
Have a look at the documentation related to creating extensions. It’s a very good starting point <a href="https://slicer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer_guide/extensions.html" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Extensions — 3D Slicer documentation</a></p>
