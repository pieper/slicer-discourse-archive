<p>Hey Guys,<br>
I have a little problem when I want to import a CT-Scan to Slicer. If I do so, only a short and small part of the CT-scan appears. If I try to import it to other softwares like invesalius or ITK-Snap, it works without any problems. Do you have an idea what might be the problem?</p>
<p>I would be thankfull for any help</p>
<p>Greetings Jan</p>
