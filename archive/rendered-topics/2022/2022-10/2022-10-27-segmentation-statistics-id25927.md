<p>Hi please can you clarify how volume segmentation statistics is calculated in the segmentation stats? As i understand it Volume is measured by multiplying the height × width × depth = volume, but that is for a cube shape only, unless you calculate the volume based on the cumulative value of the voxel volume, can you please clarify this as I must explain in my thesis how your segmentation statistics calculates the specific volume of my segmentations, in my case the liver volume and tumours (already segmented).</p>
<p>Thank you, Sandie,</p>
