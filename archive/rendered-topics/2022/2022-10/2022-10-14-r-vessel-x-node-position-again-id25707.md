<p>Another question: I specified all portal vein nodes. Why the button “Extract Vessels from node tree” continue in gray color without activating it?</p>

<p>It seems that RVX extension developers not monitor the forum. You can try to mention <a class="mention" href="/u/thibault_pelletier">@Thibault_Pelletier</a> or submit your question to the <a href="https://github.com/R-Vessel-X/SlicerRVXLiverSegmentation">RVX project repository</a>.</p>
