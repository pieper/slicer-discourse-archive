<p>How can I change the position of an imported stl model? I want to put two models of the skull on top of each other, unfortunately they are oriented slightly differently in space.<br>
Is it possible to reposition one of the models in the Slicer? If so, how to do it?</p>

<p>If doing this manually suits your use case- apply a transform using the transforms module.<br>
Else you can look into the model registration capabilities that are available in slicer</p>
