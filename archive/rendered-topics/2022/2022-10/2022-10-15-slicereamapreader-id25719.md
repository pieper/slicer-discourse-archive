<p>I am currently working with SlicerEAMapReader and was wondering if anyone had an images that they would be willing to share with me. These would be output images from softwares such as carto 3, EnSite, Rhythmia, etc. It would be much appreciated. Thank you.</p>

<p>Example files were posted on this forum, for example <a href="https://discourse.slicer.org/t/import-carto-electroanatomic-maps-to-slicer/19316/3">here</a>. As far as I remember there were some more, search on this forum for “carto”, etc. to find them.</p>
