<p>I am trying to use your 3D Slicer RVXLiverSegmentation plug-in, but I have some problems:</p>
<p>i) I specified all portal vein nodes. Why does the button “Extract Vessels from node tree” continue in gray color without activating it?<br>
ii) When I was trying to specify the nodes of the vessels, I tried to view the “node position help window”. But, that window appears completely white color. Without any tree vessels. Why?</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Gonzalo Rojas Costa</p>
