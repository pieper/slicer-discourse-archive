<p>Hi!</p>
<p>I need to segment a ROI (a round or square of specific dimension), located in the same position, in selected slices. I tried to use scissor but I have two problems:<br>
1- I cannot control scissor cutting dimension<br>
2. I cannot select the first and the last slice in which apply the segmentation.</p>
<p>Someone can help me please?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>This sounds doable with a little python code to control the parameters.</p>
