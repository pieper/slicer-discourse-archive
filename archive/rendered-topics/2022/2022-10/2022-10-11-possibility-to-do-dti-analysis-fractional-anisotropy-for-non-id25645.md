<p>Hello</p>
<p>I have data the pelvis and would like to analyze fractional anisotropy. Now I have noticed that in Slicer DMRI  (in Diffusion → Process) there is only the option “Diffusion Brain Masking”, but in my case it is non-brain. Does anyone know if the further analyses are still accurate or are there other options for non-brain data?</p>
<p>Thanks and best,<br>

<p>If you have a diffusion weighted MRI scan that’s compatible with the module then you should be able to use the generic tools.  I know the code has been used for heart and other areas before.</p>
