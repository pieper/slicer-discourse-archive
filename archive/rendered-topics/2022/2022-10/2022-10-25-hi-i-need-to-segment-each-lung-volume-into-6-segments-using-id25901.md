<p>Did you look at the Segment Editor documentation? <a href="https://slicer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/image_segmentation.html" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Image Segmentation — 3D Slicer documentation</a></p>

<p>Which well-defined landmarks do you have?</p>

<p>I would start with using these 2 planes:<br>
-one horizontal plane touching the inferior aspect of the end of main bronchi(i.e., when they divide)  to dissect upper from lower lung segments<br>
-one coronal plane passing trough the anterior aspect of the vertebra T12</p>
