<p>Hi,<br>
I’m working on trying to do an automatic markup of points on a model of a skull. I’ll be creating the model with sample MR Head images using segment editor. I want to write a python script which automates the process of markup of points on the skull. ( This markup will be used for fiducial registration and linked to Unity using OpenIGT).</p>
<p>What I’m looking to do is kind of drop a plane with a bunch of points onto the skull that recognises when it hits the skull and takes the shape of the skull kind of like a cloth. Now the points on the plane will become my markup points.</p>
