<p>Dears in 3D Slicer,<br>
I am conducting a project in which I am calculating mandibular condyle displacement after surgery by measuring the positional changes between two different timepoints CT (T1 and T2), (THIS IS DONE),<br>
The second part, I want to measure the condylar remodeling of the condyle between T2 and T3 (Within the 1st month and one year postoperatively, respectively) sing SPHARM, so could you please help me in this regard, how to use it to achieve this step? 2) is there any other method that I can use in 3D Slicer to measure condylar remodeling?<br>
thank you so much for your continuous support and appreciated help.</p>
