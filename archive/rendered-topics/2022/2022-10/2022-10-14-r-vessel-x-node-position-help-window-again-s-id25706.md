<p>Hi:</p>
<p>When I am trying to specify the nodes of the vessels, I tried to view the “node positon help window”, But, that window appears completely blank. Without any tree. Why?</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Gonzalo Rojas Costa</p>

<p>It seems that RVX extension developers not monitor the forum. You can try to mention <a class="mention" href="/u/thibault_pelletier">@Thibault_Pelletier</a> or submit your question to the <a href="https://github.com/R-Vessel-X/SlicerRVXLiverSegmentation">RVX project repository</a>.</p>
