<p>Operating system: Windows<br>
Slicer version: 5.0.3<br>
Expected behavior: The custom designed pre-trained models are working fine. I am trying to load my own model (.pth) and expecting a good result<br>
Actual behavior: On loading my own custom developed model the results are all cracked up.<br>
I want to know how to load the.pth file into the module</p>
