<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have in the past used both 3D-slicer with VMTK and with DGtal (<a href="https://dgtal.org/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://dgtal.org/</a>). The latter is more useful for large networks (pulmonary arteries), however, it doesn’t get the radii correctly for images where the voxels are not cubic.</p>
