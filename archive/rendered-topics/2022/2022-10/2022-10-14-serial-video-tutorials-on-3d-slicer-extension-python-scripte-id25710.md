<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>I have been working on the 3D Slicer extension (Python scripted modules) development for a while and learned a lot from the 3D Slicer forum. Really appreciate all the active replies to my questions!</p>
<p>I would really like to contribute to the 3D Slicer community, and I made <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zutiQtp90vU&amp;list=PLTuWbByD80TORd1R-J7j7nVQ9fot3C2fK" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">serial video tutorials</a> on 3D Slicer extension development for beginners.<br>
Here is the link to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zutiQtp90vU&amp;list=PLTuWbByD80TORd1R-J7j7nVQ9fot3C2fK" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">YouTube playlist</a>.</p>
<p>If convenient, please help me review those video tutorials and let me know if I did teach correctly somewhere. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/blush.png?v=12" title=":blush:" class="emoji" alt=":blush:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>
<p>Please feel free to leave me comments, and reply this post, so that I can make it better!</p>
<p>Looking forward to hearing your advice, and thank you so much in advance!</p>

<p>Hi Andras,</p>
<p>Thank you so much for your encouragement! I do hope those tutorials can help beginners with Slicer extension programming.</p>
<p>Just one small question, do you think those serial tutorials can be a good resource that can be added to the <a href="https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/Nightly/Training#Tutorials_for_software_developers" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">3D Slicer tutorial for developers</a>?</p>
<p>Hope they can help attract more Slicer developers.</p>
