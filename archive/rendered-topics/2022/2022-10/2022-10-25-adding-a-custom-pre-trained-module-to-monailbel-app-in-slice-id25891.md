<p>Operating system:Windows<br>
Slicer version: 5.3.0<br>
Expected behavior: Loaded a path of module (.pth file) to Deepedit config file. The model has been tested and found to generate fine results.</p>
<p>Actual behavior: The same module on using Auto-segment run function generates nothing (I was working on the same training dataset)</p>
