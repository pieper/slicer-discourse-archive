<p>No Windows build was updated today and some extensions (such as QuantitativeReporting) is missing for yesterday’s release. Maybe the Windows factory crashed?</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/sam_horvath">@Sam_Horvath</a> could you have a look? Thank you!</p>

<p>Yes, it appears that the factory froze mid build yesterday.  I have rebooted / cleaned it up. Will keep an eye on it for tomorrow’s build.</p>
<p>Thanks for reporting!</p>
