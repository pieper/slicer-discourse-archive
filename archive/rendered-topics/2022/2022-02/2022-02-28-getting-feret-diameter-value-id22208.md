<p>Hello,<br>
I am trying to calculate the ‘Ellipsoidity’ of my sample using Segment Statistics.<br>
In according to do so, I would like to get the feret diameter of my sample.<br>
However, whenever I try to use the measurement, the program runs on forever then stops working.<br>
I wonder if there is anything wrong with my sample.<br>
Can someone please take a moment to look into this problem?<br>
I would be truly greatful for your help.</p>

<p>Other measurements, such as roundness, flatness, etc., seem to work just fine.<br>
The feret diameter is only measurement that does not work.<br>
It will be wonderful to hear any advice.<br>
Thank you always for your help.</p>
