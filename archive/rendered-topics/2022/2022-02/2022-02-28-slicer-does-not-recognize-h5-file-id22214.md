<p>I am trying to upload a trained UNet model in .h5 format in 3D slicer, in order to perform segmentation on my ultrasound data. I am using the latest preview release (4.13.0) on my MacBook air. However, I face the error that the UNet model is not selected, although ii have uploaded it.<br>
The error is as below:<br>
Input image: Image_Image</p>
<p>Output image: Prediction</p>
<p>Apply button clicked without UNet model selected</p>
<p>Could you please help me with that?</p>
