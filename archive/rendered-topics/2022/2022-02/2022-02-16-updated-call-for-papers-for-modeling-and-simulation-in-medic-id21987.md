<p>Dear members of the Slicer 3D community,</p>
<p>those of you with an interest in medical simulation and deep learning applications in medicine, please consider submitting to the upcoming Modeling and Simulation in Medicine conference, as part of the  Annual Modeling and Simulation Conference (ANNSIM) . Papers featuring Work in Progress will also be accepted.</p>
<p>Please see below the Call for Papers for the MSM conference.</p>
<p><strong>Call for Contributions</strong><br>
<strong>1. Submission URL:</strong> ( <a href="http://scs.org/annsim" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">scs.org/annsim</a>)<br>
Please select Track Preference as <strong>M&amp;S in Medicine (MSM)</strong><br>
<strong>2. Note:</strong> For 2022, all events will be held in a hybrid mode: on site or virtual choices. We hope for an abatement of the viral pandemic, but we will adapt to prevailing Covid-19 conditions.</p>

<p>Medical and healthcare simulation span a variety of areas where medicine converges with Modeling and Simulation (M&amp;S). Computer-based medical simulation emphasizes the application of computers to synthesizing the response of tissues to therapy, which represents a trade-off between fidelity to real tissue response and computational efficiency. High-fidelity medical/surgical simulation is typically used to provide experienced clinicians, including surgeons, with insight on how to optimize treatment of the patient, while high-efficiency simulation emphasizes real-time interactivity for haptics, typically used in conjunction with Virtual Reality (VR) visualization for skill acquisition and training. In both cases, a computer visualization of the anatomy is needed, however in the interactive case based on VR, this visualization must be also responsive in real-time, which presupposes highly efficient therapy models (e.g., cutting models) as well as relatively sparse anatomical models and collision models, where the latter determines where the therapy takes place, in conjunction with the pose of the haptic device. A related research area is the segmentation of medical images that map intensities to tissues and discretization (meshing) that converts tissues to elements. Another intensively researched area is the application of digital deep learning (deep neural networks- DNNs) to the synthesis of a neural computation within a medical context, such as to approximate a diagnosis or a tissue response to therapy, while exploiting the ability of the solution to learn.</p>
<p>Healthcare simulation is used to denote two areas that complement the above-described medical simulation. One the one hand, it is used to designate mannequin-based training systems and part-trainers, whose physical implementation is intended to develop proprioceptive understanding of therapies. On the other, this term also represents medical processes at a large scale, such as emergency rooms, and hospitals, to formulate an understanding of bottlenecks in patient treatment and improve efficiencies.</p>
