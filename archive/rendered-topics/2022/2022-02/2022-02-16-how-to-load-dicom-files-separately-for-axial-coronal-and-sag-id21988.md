<p>Dear All,</p>
<p>I have some ‘jpg’ image file which was extracted from 3D numerical simulations. I images are extracted in all 3 views (Axial, Coronal and Sagittal). Now, I converted these images to dicom files based on standard dicom informations.</p>
<p>For axial, coronal and sagittal, I changed the I<strong>nstanceNumber, ImagePositionPatient, ImageOrientationPatient</strong> accordingly.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>When I load all 3 combined files together, all the files show in axial panel only.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If I load only axial, the coronal and sagittal views are automatically constructed from those axial plane slices. But I dont want this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>How do I load all 3 views in a separate window?</strong></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Any leads will be appreciated.</p>
<p>Regards,<br>
Sunag R A.</p>
