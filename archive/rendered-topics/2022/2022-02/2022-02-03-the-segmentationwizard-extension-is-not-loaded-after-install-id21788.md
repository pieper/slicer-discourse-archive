<p>Hi, I am having a issue of launching the extension “segmentationwizard” in 3d slicer version 4.11.20210226.</p>
<p>It can not be found in the drop down list and show “SegmentationWizard module is not loaded” after I manually search in the search field.</p>
<p>Hoping someone can help me resolve this issue.<br>
Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>The extension is not maintained anymore - see this <a href="https://github.com/QTIM-Lab/SlicerSegmentationWizard/issues/1">bug</a> unresolved for over two years. Since SegmentationWizard extension just made Slicer core features available with a somewhat simplified user interface, you don’t need to use it.</p>
<p>You can learn more about Slicer’s segmentation features <a href="https://slicer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/image_segmentation.html">here</a>. If you tell more about your segmentation task then we can provide more specific help.</p>
