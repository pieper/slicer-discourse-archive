<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I have a script with four steps in order to segment different coronary regions. I need my script to wait so I can manually do the segmentation. Is there any way I can run the script, let it waiting and then wake it up (for example, by setting a variable)? It would be useful if I can use two python interactors and both of them can see the variables.<br>
Interactor 1: waits<br>
Interactor 2: wakes up</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
