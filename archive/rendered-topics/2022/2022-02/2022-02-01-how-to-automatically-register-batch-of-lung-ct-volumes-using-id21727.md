<p>I have around 100 pairs of CT lung volumes to be deformably registered by SlicerElastix extension using its “3D CT, monomodal” modality. All volumes are in nii file format. I now do it one-by-one manually. However each registration takes quite a lot of time, around 15mins, before it can output the volumes. So I am thinking if I can do them all automatically or set up a work sequence with  corresponding input volumes using python script under the Python interactor. Any help would be very much appreciated. Thank you.</p>
