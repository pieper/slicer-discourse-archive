<p>I’m a novice so please excuse the broad question. I’m wanting to compare the shape and articulation of two bones. I want to analyze the shape of one bone and where it sits on the articulating bone. I was looking at slicerSALT, as the bones can vary considerably in some species and I read this is a good extension for that problem. Does anyone have any experience and/or would consider meeting via zoom to discuss my project, slicerSALT, or perhaps some other extension that might be better for my research?</p>
