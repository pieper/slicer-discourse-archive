<p>I am new to pyradiomics.<br>
I have used CIPs Interactive lobe segmentation to get a lung label map(lmap.nrrd). and I’m using a ct.nrrd as my input volume, obtained from dicoms. I wanted to know if I can use this ct and lmap to extract features with pyradiomics. Interactive lobe segmentation produces a label map with multiple labels for lobes. Is that still ok? I have to use “minimumROIDimensions: 1” to make it work.</p>
<p>I just want to know if this is correct or not? Am I making a mistake?</p>
