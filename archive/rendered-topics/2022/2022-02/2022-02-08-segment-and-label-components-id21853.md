<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am new user and I have a stack of TIFF images generated by neutron computed tomography.<br>
I wonder if I can use different colors to label different components of the 3D structure based on the histogram.</p>
<p>Thanks for help.</p>

<p>Yes, sure, there are many ways to achieve this kind of segmentation or coloring.</p>
<p>You can go to Segment Editor module and for each region create a new segment and fill it using Threshold effect.</p>
<p>You can also do this fully automatically by copy-pasting this Python code snippet into the Python interactor: <a href="https://gist.github.com/lassoan/5ad51c89521d3cd9c5faf65767506b37">https://gist.github.com/lassoan/5ad51c89521d3cd9c5faf65767506b37</a></p>
