<p>Hello. I would ask for some help with teeth segmentation in slicer.<br>
I have a CT of the teeth, I need to segment each tooth. Now I select a tooth, and paint it on each slice. How can i speed up selection?</p>

<p>Hi!</p>
<p>We have prepared a few articles about this topic.<br>
You can read one here: <a href="https://bmcoralhealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12903-020-01342-w" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Digital three-dimensional visualization of intrabony periodontal defects for regenerative surgical treatment planning | BMC Oral Health | Full Text</a></p>
<p>You can either use the combination of level tracing on every 5th slice and fill between slices<br>
OR<br>
You can use grow from seeds by painting over the tooth and over the background in two separate segments</p>
<p>I hope this helps</p>

<p>Hi,<br>
One way to speed this process is to use sphere brush.</p>
<p>Hope this may help</p>
