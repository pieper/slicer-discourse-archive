<p>I’m trying to calculate the diameter of a vessel (segmented from DICOM) at any desired point in the model.</p>
<p>I have used VMTK Extract Centreline to plot a centreline with &gt;200 points to allow for selection of the desired location in the model however I cannot calculate the distance from the centreline point to the boundary of the model/segmentation.</p>
<p>Using the centreline quantification gives only the values of entire branches</p>
