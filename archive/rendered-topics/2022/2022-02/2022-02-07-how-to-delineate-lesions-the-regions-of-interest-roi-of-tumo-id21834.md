<p>Dear</p>
<p>I am writing to you to see the possibility that you can help me with an investigation related to the use of the 3d Slicer system.</p>
<p>I wanted to know if you know how to delineate lesions (the regions of interest “ROI” of tumor) in MRI automatically and not manually with the 3D Slicer system.</p>
<p>Thank you very much.</p>
