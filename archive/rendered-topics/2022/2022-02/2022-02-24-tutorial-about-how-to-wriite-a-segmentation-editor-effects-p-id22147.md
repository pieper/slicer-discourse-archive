<p>Hi there!<br>
Currently I want to implement a seg. algorithm with the help of Slicer Segementation Editor. My question is is there any guide/tutorials to begin? I have already downloaded the plugins such as Nvidia AIAA etc. and went through their python code in Slicer-build\NA-MIC\Extensions-29738\ subfolders. But I am stiil not so clear of the development protocal. Thanks.</p>
