<p>hello Andras, and thanks for your support!</p>
<p>I read this thread and many others because I’m having issues while trying to upload a 3D US volume acquired with a Siemens system.</p>
<p>I will summarize, and I would like to know if you can help me:</p>
<ul>
<li>when I try to load using DCM module, I get this error</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Could not load:  - as a 36 frames MultiVolume by ImagePositionPatient+AcquisitionTime as a MultiVolume</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>when I load as data the files, they are deformed (elongated)</li>
<li>I tried the Slicer Heart plugin and Raw Image Guess with no success</li>
<li>I used the 7CF2 probe (<a href="https://renchengmedical.en.made-in-china.com/product/MwdxvDgWkUhK/China-Siemens-7CF2-Ultrasound-Probe-Transducer-for-S2000-S3000.html" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">ref</a>) and an Acuson S3000</li>
</ul>
<p>I can share a US scan if needed, it’s phantom data.</p>
<p>Please, let me know how can I solve this issue.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
