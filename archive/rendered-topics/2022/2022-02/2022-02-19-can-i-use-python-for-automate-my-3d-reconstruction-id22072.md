<p>hello!<br>
I use python for segments dicom files. and I want to use 3d slicer for the<br>
3d reconstruction.<br>
are 3D slicer has the possibility to be automated with a script code?<br>
could it be direct from python (pycharm or jupter notebook) ? or I would need to open it in 3d slicer?<br>
thank you for helping!</p>
