<p>Dear Community,<br>
I am new to pyradiomics and currently try to compare different scanners to each other. There is a difference in shape features even though the organs are about the same size in real world. (The nifti images also have a different size (like 22,351,483 vs 27,702,966 in the other scanner))<br>
How can I take these differences into account when calculating features and does the size have an influence on first order and second order features? Just resampling the spacing unfortunately doesn’t change anything.</p>
<p>Many thanks in advance</p>
