<p>Hello sir</p>
<p>I have some doubts regarding soft tissue deformation , when I am going to fiducial registration wizard and adding some points then performing deformation but when I am going to other coronal sections and adding some other sets of points for performing deformation then my previous deformation is getting lost (moving back to the original ) What to do in such cases ?Please help.</p>
