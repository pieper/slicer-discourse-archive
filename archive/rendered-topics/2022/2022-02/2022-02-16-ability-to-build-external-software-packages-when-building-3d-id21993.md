<p>Dear Developers and Users</p>
<p>I have packages that use CMake to compile and install them. I did the steps of building them independently on Ubuntu 20.04 with commands such as <strong>cmake</strong> and <strong>make</strong> successfully. Also I built 3DSlicer as mentioned in <a href="https://slicer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer_guide/build_instructions/linux.html" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Build Instructions — 3D Slicer documentation</a> successfully.<br>
At now I want to add these packages to 3DSlicer so that they can be built while doing the building process for 3DSlicer.</p>
<p>Please guide me to doing it.<br>
Best regards.<br>
Shahrokh</p>
