<p>Hey,</p>
<p>I segmented the head of a femur bone in matlab with the help of the Volume Segmenter App.<br>
Now I am trying to import the segmentation into 3d Slice to segment it further.<br>
The problem is that the alignment of the Segmentation to the MRT is always wrong.</p>
<p>To import the logical 3d array from matlab I transformed it into a stl file but the coordinate system seems to be shifted because of matlab.</p>
<p>Is there a way to align the segmentation to the coordinates of my MRT file or a better way to import the logical 3d array from matlab into 3d Slice?</p>
<p>I am very new to 3d Slice and 3d segmentation in general so I would appreciate the help <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"><br>
thanks</p>
