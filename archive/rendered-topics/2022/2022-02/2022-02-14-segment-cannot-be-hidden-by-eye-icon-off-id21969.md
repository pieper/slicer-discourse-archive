<p>Thank you for your advice.I will try the new version.<br>
But I have noticed that my way of saving the data  nrml. might be wrong. I saved it with renaming only nrml data. So next time, I handled double same name segmentation data simaltaneously. For the meantime, I corrected each segmentation data names unique.<br>
I noticed it by watching the data module,which I never used.<br>
I will inform the result of new version use.</p>
