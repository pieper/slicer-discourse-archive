<p>Dear all,</p>
<p>I just wonder where I can find some CT images (micro-CT) for mice/rats to practice.<br>
Could you please share some with me if you have?</p>
<p>ps: I develop a code for autonomous segmentation of mice/rat organs.</p>
<p>Kind Regards</p>

<p>Did you try MorphoSource (<a href="https://morphosource.org" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://morphosource.org</a>)?</p>

<p>Hi Murat,</p>
<p>Thanks for the repository source you have shared.</p>
<p>I have already requested some downloads at this website, I am still waiting for the owners’ response. It is so slow to get some image series from there. I was actually looking for some researchers (in this platform) to share some micro-CTs or give me some other idea about where I can find some quickly. In the worst case scnario, I will be waiting for the owners’ reply at (<a href="https://morphosource.org/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://morphosource.org</a>).</p>
<p>Anyway, thanks for the info!</p>

<p>Scientific data (nature) is also a good open access Journal to find data sets:<br>
e.g.<br>
<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata2018294" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata2018294</a><br>
and the link to the repository of the µCT data. The data is in the Analyze file format (not dicom but Slicer can open it)</p><aside class="onebox allowlistedgeneric" data-onebox-src="https://figshare.com/collections/A_preclinical_micro-computed_tomography_database_including_3D_whole_body_organ_segmentations/4224377/1">

<p>Hi Steffen,</p>
<p>It has worked well. Thanks for the information. People on (<a href="https://morphosource.org/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://morphosource.org</a>) also replied. It just took couple of days.</p>
<p>Thanks a lot.</p>
<p>Best</p>
