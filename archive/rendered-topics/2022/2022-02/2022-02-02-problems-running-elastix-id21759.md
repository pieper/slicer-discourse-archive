<p>Hi,<br>
I have been using 3D Slicer for months, without ever having had any problems; yesterday I had to uninstall it, and then I proceeded to reinstall the new version 4.11.<br>
However I am encountering many problems (for example, registration with Elastix that does not end but causes the program to crash).<br>
I tried alternatively to download the preview version 4.13 but with it, as soon as I try to download the Elastix tool, it crashes.<br>
I don’t know if it could be significant, but 3 weeks ago I upgraded my system to windows 11<br>
Thank you</p>

<p>In the latest Slicer Preview Release I’ve updated Elastix to its latest version (the update version is available for download from tomorrow). It would be great if you could test it and let us know if it works.</p>
