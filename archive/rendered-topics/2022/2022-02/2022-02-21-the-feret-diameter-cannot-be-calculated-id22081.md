<p>Dear all,<br>
I had trouble loading Labelmap Statistics from the Segment Statistics module.<br>
I tried all the plugin parameters and noticed that the Feret diameter mm is the only one that does not work.<br>
I wonder if this had anything to do with the fact that I could not download ShapeVariationAnalyzer for the current version of the slicer I am using.<br>
Does anyone else have this kind of problem?<br>
Any advice on how to solve this problem?</p>
