<p>Since about 3 days, I’m no longer receiving any email for posts in the forum. This has been working for years. Turning ‘Mailing list mode’ to ‘On’ does not change anything.</p>
<p>For about 2 days before this, my mailbox was suspended by the provider, alleging a compromised mail account. This has been fixed.</p>
<p>Can you consider/hint for a fix ?</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Interesting, we recently heard people having the opposite problem.</p>
<p>Since this is a hosted system from discourse we don’t have a lot of control.  Maybe try contacting them or worst case creating a new account with a different address?</p>

<p>I’ve checked your account and the bounce score (number of bounced emails) was very high. I’ve reset the counter so probably you can receive emails again.</p>

<p>I messaged them before the worst case scenario. Thanks.</p>
