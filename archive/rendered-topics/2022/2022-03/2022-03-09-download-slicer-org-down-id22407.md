<p>I’m unable to access <a href="http://download.slicer.org" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">download.slicer.org</a> today and my old download I tried yesterday failed and keeps failing when I try to restart it. Are there any alternative download links? I’m looking for the latest stable OS X dmg.</p>

<p>Hmm, not sure what’s different but the download works for me (just downloaded the latest mac preview build with no problem).</p>
