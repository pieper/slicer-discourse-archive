<p>Operating system:win 10<br>
Slicer version:4.13(2022-02-28)<br>
Expected behavior:<br>
Actual behavior:How to use 3D Slicer for DBS tissue activation area (VTA) reconstruction?</p>

<p>Hi Zhang, assuming you have already used Lead-DBS to calculate the VTAs, you can open them in Slicer as volumes. VTAs are inside the stimulations folder and you can recognize them by naming.</p>
<p>There is currently no implementation in Slicer to calculate VTAs from our team.</p>
