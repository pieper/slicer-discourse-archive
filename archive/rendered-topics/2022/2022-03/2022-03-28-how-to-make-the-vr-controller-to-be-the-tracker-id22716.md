<p>I would like to turn the vr controller to be a tracker to perform a <a href="https://onedrive.live.com/view.aspx?resid=7230D4DEC6058018!29379&amp;ithint=file%2cpptx&amp;authkey=!AL2fpr9tHQTEWNA" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">brain surgery navigation</a>.</p>
<p>I would like to ask that is it possible to do? If yes, how can I perform it?</p>
<p>My VR device is Oculus Quest 2.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

<p>The Oculus Quest 2 device is not yet supported by the SlicerVirtualReality extension.</p>
<p>For supported devices you can turn on “Controller transforms” in the VirtualReality module after installing said extension to enable using the controllers as spatially tracked devices.</p>

<p>I use the Oculus Quest 2 in the Slicer VR module. However its necessary to use It by the SteamVR aplication. It functions like a regular Oculus Rift.</p>
