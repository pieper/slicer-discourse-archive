<p>Hi ,<br>
I am using the 3D view to verify CT 3D image.<br>
I use the Ctrl+mouse_Left_button to view the rotation in plane, it’s good.<br>
But is there any way to change the motion to rotation like spin the 3D view(Just YawLeft or YawRight).<br>

by using mouse button drag or just mouse scroll button to spin the 3D view.</p>
<p>Thanks<br>
Sky</p>
