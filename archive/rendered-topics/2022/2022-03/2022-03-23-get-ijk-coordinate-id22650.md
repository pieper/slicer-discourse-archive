<p>Hello,<br>
how we can get the click coordinate of the mouse in IJK coordinate system? we need to select the segmentation voxel, I am trying to find the relationship between the coordinate system.<br>
we need the transform matrix between RAS to IJK coordinate system.<br>
any code c++ can do that?</p>
<p>thanks<br>
Hayssam</p>

<p>Dear Haytham,</p>
<p>Check <a href="https://slicer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer_guide/script_repository.html#get-volume-voxel-coordinates-from-markup-control-point-ras-coordinates" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">this</a>, it should help you.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

<p>How are they incorrect?<br>
I mean, what do you expect, and what are you obtaining?<br>
Did you compare with what you can read directly in 3D Slicer?</p>
<p>Cheers</p>
