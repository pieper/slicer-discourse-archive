<p>I have with me a dataset for brain tumour detection</p>
<p><a href="https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/display/Public/REMBRANDT#:~:text=REMBRANDT%20contains%20data%20generated%20through,13%2C472%20clinical%20phenotype%20data%20points" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">REMBRANDT - The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) Public Access - Cancer Imaging Archive Wiki</a>.</p>
<p>I want to extract radiomic features by using pyradiomics library. However, mask file is necessary for the same for every image which is not present in the dataset and is to be created. How to create mask file for all the images?</p>
