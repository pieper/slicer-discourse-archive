<p>Hello, this is rather a general question regarding the functioning of the algorithm.</p>
<p>I have some ROIs that I use to extract image pixel intensity from images and would like to re-use these ROIs in feature detection. However, the ROIs are discontinuous (meaning that the a specific tissue is marked on different places in the scan, without there being connection between those tissues).</p>
<p>The radiomics program (at least pyradiomics) does produce a csv when using this ROI.</p>
<p>Will the output be anyhow affected by the discontinuity, i mean does the ROI border affect the feature recognition somehow?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for the answer,</p>
<p>Amir</p>
