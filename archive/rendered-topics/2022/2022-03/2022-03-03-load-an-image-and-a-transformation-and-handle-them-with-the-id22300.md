<p>Hi,<br>
I would like to load an image and a transformation matrix in Slicer <strong>with Python</strong><br>
I would like then to visualise the image in the “red view” for example.<br>
Then I would like to convert the image and the transformation in a format compatible with the IGT  Volume Reslice Driver module in order to view the transformed image in the 3D viewer.</p>
<p>Is it something feasible? Do you have any suggestions how to do it?</p>
<p>Thank you</p>
