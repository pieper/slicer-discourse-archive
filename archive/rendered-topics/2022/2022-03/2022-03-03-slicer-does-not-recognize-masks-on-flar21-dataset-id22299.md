<p>Hello,</p>
<p>So when I load the masks from FLAR21 dataset, the slicer does not recognize them as masks, but when I use some other dataset, also with multi-label masks, it does recognize them.</p>
<p>Does it have to do with the data (meta-data?) or does it have to do with slicer?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
