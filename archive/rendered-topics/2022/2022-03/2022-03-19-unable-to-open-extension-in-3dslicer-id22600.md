<p>After installing an extension in ‘Extensions manager’, I opened ‘Extensions Wizard&gt;Select Extension’ to select an extension to open in 3D slicer. but it comes with an error message reading:<br>
Failed to open extension ‘G:/734-win-amd64-ModelToModelDistance-git4b4e478-2020-03-18 (2)/30734-win-amd64-ModelToModelDistance-git4b4e478-2020-03-18/lib’.</p>

<p>The Extensions Wizard is for adding modules to the source code of an extension. The source code can be obtained by cloning the git repository.</p>
<p>The wizard cannot do anything with extension installation package (downloaded from the Extensions Manager or from the CDash dashboard).</p>
<p>What would you like to do do with the ModelToModelDistance extension?</p>
