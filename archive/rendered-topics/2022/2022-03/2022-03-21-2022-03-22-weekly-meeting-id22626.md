<p>And don’t forget the US is on daylight savings time (summer time) so the meeting may be an hour early for some people.</p>

<p>Pull requests to discuss:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Slicer/Slicer/pull/6277" class="inline-onebox">Use more inclusive language by jamesobutler · Pull Request #6277 · Slicer/Slicer · GitHub</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Considering that GitHub provide a mechanism to rename and will ensure older links redirect as well providing instructions for developer so that they update their local fork. I think it is sensible to move forward with this.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/Slicer/Slicer/pull/6276/" class="inline-onebox">Update website links to https sites by jamesobutler · Pull Request #6276 · Slicer/Slicer · GitHub</a></p>
<ul>
<li>After addressing few nitpicks, integrating this is also sensible.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
