<p>Hello 3Dslicer support team<br>
I hope this massage finds you well.</p>
<p>As you can see my 3D model and coronal and sagittal views in 3D slicer has noise like these. but there is high quality images in axial view. I tried to rescale or reslice this Dicom file but I couldn’t get the result. Also I couldn’t get the corrected results when I was trying to segment model just using axial view.<br>
So I will appreciate if you help me to get a good 3D model</p>
