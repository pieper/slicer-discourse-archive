<p>Yesterday, I started getting emails for each message on the forum. This morning I tried to explain it to myself. I thought I accidentally created a new account and new accounts had “mailing list mode” turned on by default. But I just added my private email address as an alternate address to the profile, and realized that this is the same profile I have been using for a while.</p>
<p>Did anyone have a similar experience? Does anyone have an explanation for it?</p>

<p>I haven’t noticed any difference in my email notifications. We use a hosted Discourse and it gets updates regularly, so some behavior changes might be possible due to these, but not very likely.</p>
<p>If you still get unexpected emails then write me in a private message your email address where you get these emails to.</p>

<p>I went to settings and turned of “Mailing list mode”. The emails have stop, as expected. Since I don’t remember touching that setting, I don’t know why it happened. I thought, if I wasn’t alone, it might be some bug in Discourse.</p>

<p>I had the same issue of suddenly getting many emails today. Thanks for letting me know how to fix it! Must be a bug or settings change somewhere.</p>
