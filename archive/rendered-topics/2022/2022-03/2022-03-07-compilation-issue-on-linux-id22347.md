<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>I have a compilation issue recently on Slicer master.<br>
Does it ring any bell to anyone?</p>
<p>…build_slicer/python-build/lib/python3.9/lib-dynload/<em>sysconfigdata__linux2</em>.py":<br>
No such file or directory.<br>
Call Stack (most recent call first):<br>
cmake_install.cmake:109 (include)</p>
<p>Cheers,<br>
Pierre</p>

<p><a class="mention" href="/u/riep">@riep</a>, could you give more information about your setup? What Linux distribution are you using? Which version of Slicer are you trying to build?</p>

<p>Sorry for not responding earlier. I am on Ubuntu, and it was the master branch at that time. I usually build the application withtout any problem.<br>
If you do not have a compilation issue on Ubuntu, it may be related to my configuration.<br>
Thanks</p>
