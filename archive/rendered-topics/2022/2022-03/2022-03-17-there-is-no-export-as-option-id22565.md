<p>Hi everyone. I am trying to export some data from the “data” module however, when I right click the fiduciary I can only see the “export DICOM” option.<br>
When I downloaded slicer morph I seem to recall some warning about not finding the sandbox dependency.<br>
I hope this is enough info</p>

  <blockquote>
    “Export as…” was previously available as part of the SlicerMorph extension. It was recently <a href="https://github.com/SlicerMorph/SlicerMorph/commit/56ca0f827c3999dc547f726d46db3fff506602a1" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">removed</a> from SlicerMorph because the feature is now available in the latest Slicer Preview. Since SlicerMorph specifies to the use latest version of its extension in both Slicer stable (4.11.20210226) and latest Slicer Preview that means “Export As…” is no longer available from SlicerMorph when using Slicer stable. You will need to switch to using latest Slicer Preview available from <a href="https://download.slicer.org/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://download.slic…</a>
