<p>I have a series of DICOM files, that for some reason will not import as a volume of DICOM images when I use the DICOM series import options. I can drag the folder of the containing files in under normal circumstances, or use these options under normal circumstances, but for some reason, it is not allowing me to do so with these files. Is there a method to concatenate DICOM or other image files in the Data import module?</p>
