<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am currently searching for a good method to test for radiomics feature stability.<br>
Unfortionetly, I do not have the opportunity to do a test-retesting as I am working with retrospective data.<br>
Is there any good method to do it and is the interclass correlation coefficient (ICC) the best choice?</p>
<p>Best,<br>
Jonas</p>
