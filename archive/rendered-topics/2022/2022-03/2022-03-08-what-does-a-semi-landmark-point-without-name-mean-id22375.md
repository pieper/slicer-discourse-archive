1、in marksup module,i use resample to generate semi-landmark,but some of those have not names,does this mean anything special?<br>
2、are pseudo-landmarks the same as semi-landmarks?<br>

<p>No, there is nothing special about those named points.</p>

</aside>
<p>There are no strict definitions for semi- vs pseudoLM. In SlicerMorph we use term semiLMs for designated geometrically samples landmarks that are bounded by manually placed anatomical landmarks (e.g., those are generated by CreateSemiLMPatches module). PseudoLMs have no such constraints.</p>
