<p>Operating system: 3d slicer (window 64bit?) I don’t know what exactly mean…<br>
Slicer version:4.11<br>
Expected behavior: 3d model superimposition<br>
Actual behavior: hello, I’m user of 3d slicer 4.11 version. Then I have a question of function.<br>
When I use superimosition module through volumn rendering tap, (I usually superimpose pretreatment and possttreatment volume with CT bone preset) I want to control opacity of posttreatment volume. but I don’s know the tap of it. Is there any module which I must download?<br>
Thankyou for your helpp</p>

<p>Would you like to display pre and post treatment volumes in 3D, in the same space, using volume rendering?</p>
