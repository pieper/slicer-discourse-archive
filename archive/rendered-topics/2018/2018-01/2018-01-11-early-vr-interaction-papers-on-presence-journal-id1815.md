<p>During the VR interaction session at the recent Project Week, we discussed interaction modes.  I was reminded of early research by some former colleagues at Univ. of Central Florida.  Here is a URL and Bibliography to some of the work that might be of interest:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/pres.1995.4.4.403" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/pres.1995.4.4.403</a></p>
<p>[Daniel P. Mapes and J. Michael Moshell]<br>
Presence: Teleoperators and Virtual Environments<br>
Volume 4 | Issue 4 | Fall 1995<br>
p.403-416</p>
<p>This is the work I described about selecting a nearby object to establish a coordinate system transformation and move the world with respect to the eyepoint instead of flying the eyepoint towards the target object.  The point was made about simulation sickness when moving the eyepoint, but our lab’s work indicated this paradigm of direct manipulation of the virtual environment was effective.</p>
<p>Some literature search of the PRESENCE journal might help us take advantage of some of  the earlier work.    It is nice to see that rendering and VR technology is finally more widely accessible.</p>

<p>Thank you. I’ve added this to the Project Week <a href="https://github.com/NA-MIC/ProjectWeek/blob/master/PW27_2018_Boston/BreakoutSessions/AR-VR.md">AR/VR breakout session notes</a>.</p>
