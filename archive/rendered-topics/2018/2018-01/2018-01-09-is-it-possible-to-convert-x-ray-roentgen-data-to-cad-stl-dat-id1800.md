<p>From a single X-ray projection image you cannot get too much 3D information. However, if by X-ray you mean CT, then the answer is yes, you can do it, it is a quite common operation. To get started, check out <a href="https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/Nightly/Training#Slicer4_Image_Segmentation">Segment editor tutorials</a>.</p>
