Slicer version:4.9</p>
<p>hi guys, this is way over my head, can expert look into this paper and see if this can be made into a module?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>If the authors make the implementation available and the implementation relies on freely available toolkits (e.g. ITK) then making a Slicer module can be pretty straightforward.  If all you have is the paper then it can be hard to reduce it to practice.</p>
