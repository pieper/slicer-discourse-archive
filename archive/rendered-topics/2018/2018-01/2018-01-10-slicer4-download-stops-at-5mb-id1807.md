<p>I downloaded it twice in the past few hours (the 4.8.1 Windows release from Windows 10). It’s strange that it starts to download and then stops. I’d expect it to go all the way or not start at all, and have no idea why it stops after downloading a few MBs.</p>

<p>I’ve tried it now and it worked well for me (downloaded the full package under 2 minutes).</p>
