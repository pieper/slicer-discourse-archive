<p>Operating system:Window<br>
Slicer version:4.8.0<br>
Hello Slicer community,<br>
I would like to try some quantification Tools on SPECT (Iode 131) with slicer interface. I can open the image, use the segmentation standard Tools and the label quantification Tools. So it works quite fine.<br>
I would like to know if anyone have experience with this type of image with 3DSlicer?<br>
I was thinking of trying an otsu threshold and then a connected compoment itk filter to separate the different lesion that can appear.<br>
Have a nice day,<br>
