<p>Hi Slicers,</p>
<p>Following the winter break, we had an outstanding <a href="https://na-mic.github.io/ProjectWeek/PW27_2018_Boston/">27th project</a> week taking place at MIT CSAIL in Cambridge where more than 70 attendees worked on 52 projects and attended 5 breakout sessions.</p>
<p>Starting this <strong>January 16th 2018</strong>, we will resume our regular weekly Slicer meeting taking place at <strong>10am EST</strong>.</p>
<p>Anyone will be welcome to join to ask questions at <a href="https://bit.ly/slicer-googlemeet-hosted-by-kitware">https://bit.ly/slicer-googlemeet-hosted-by-kitware</a></p>
<p>Best,<br>

<p>Is there a hangout today? I’m “Asking to join” (and did last week too) but there seems to be no response.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<blockquote>

<p>We can definitively. The hangout is now <strong>open</strong> for the next 30mins.</p>
<p>Also apologize for not starting the meeting. Was distracted working on an other project.</p>

<p>Strange. Last week, <a class="mention" href="/u/pieper">@pieper</a> and I were definitively attending.</p>
