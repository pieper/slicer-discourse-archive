<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I’d like if it’s possible to do a output device in Plus Toolkit. I’m going to describe the process.</p>
<p>I’ll recive from two devices, I want to mix the datas that I recived in plus, and then send via OpenIGTLink to Slicer.</p>
<p>I’s possible??</p>
<p>Thanks a lot<br>
Jorge</p>

<p>Yes, it is possible. Please post questions about how to write Plus configuration files to <a href="https://github.com/PlusToolkit/PlusLib/issues/new">Plus toolkit’s GitHub page</a>. Don’t forget to attach your current configuration file.</p>
