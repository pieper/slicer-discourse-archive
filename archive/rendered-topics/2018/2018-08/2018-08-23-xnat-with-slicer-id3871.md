<p>Is there any recent developments to integrate Slicer with XNAT? I have tried the XNATSlicer plugin, but seems that it does not work with the recent version of Slicer and the development on Github has stopped a few years ago.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance.</p>

<p>I don’t think anyone has tried recently - what errors did you get? (for error logs from past runs see Help -&gt; report a bug)  That’s a scripted module and it’s probably easy to fix any slicer issues if the xnat side hasn’t changed.</p>

<p>Did you try asking on the XNAT forum? The extension is maintained by the XNAT core team, to the best of my knowledge.</p>
<p>I suggest you add a note to <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/topic/xnat_discussion/iPDAXWZ0jms/discussion">this thread on XNAT forum</a> to make sure the team knows there is interest in using this extension.</p>
