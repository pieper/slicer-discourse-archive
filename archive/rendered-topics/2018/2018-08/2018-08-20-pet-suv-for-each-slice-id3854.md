<p>I have used <strong>PET Standard Uptake Value Computation</strong> and a table of results for the whole volume is given. Is there a way to get the SUV results for each slice? Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>If you install the PETDICOM extension, you should be able to load DICOM PET series SUV normalized. See details and demo here: <a href="http://qiicr.org/tool/PETDICOM/">http://qiicr.org/tool/PETDICOM/</a>.</p>
