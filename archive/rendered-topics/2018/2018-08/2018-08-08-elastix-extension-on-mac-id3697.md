<p>Good morning,</p>
<p>I am trying to download Elastix extension on Mac but I don’t succeed…<br>
I have read and tried through these explanations : <a href="https://github.com/SuperElastix/elastix/wiki/FAQ" rel="nofollow noopener">https://github.com/SuperElastix/elastix/wiki/FAQ</a> , <a href="https://discourse.slicer.org/t/error-with-new-extension-elastix/278">Error with new extension Elastix</a> and <a href="https://github.com/lassoan/SlicerElastix" rel="nofollow noopener">https://github.com/lassoan/SlicerElastix</a><br>
But it is as if I have done nothing…</p>
<p>Can someone explain me step by step what I have to do (I think that I download or load in Slicer in the bad way) ?</p>
<p>Thanks a lot in advance !</p>
<p>P.S. : Moreover, I have a little question : is it possible to save the outputvolume created with this module in a folder that I choose ?</p>
<p>Thanks a lot<br>
Laura</p>
