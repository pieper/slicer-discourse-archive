<p>My windows 10 crashed in the middle of slicing a file. When I rebooted, the program no longer opens. It tries to open then closes fast (in the task manager). I’ve tried reinstalling it. I tried removing and reinstalling it. Doesn’t work. What now.</p>

<p>Probably your settings file has been corrupted. The easiest way to fix it is to remove all files from your <a href="https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/Nightly/SlicerApplication/ApplicationSettings#Settings_file_location">Slicer settings folder</a>.</p>
