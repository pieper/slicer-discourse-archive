<p>Hi Everyone!  I am interested in using this software to import an OBJ file and then export slices as svg, pdf or other printable format.<br>
It’s not just for medical purposes but basically something similar to AutoDesks 123D program that produced slices of 3D objects that can then be cut on planes and stacked.<br>
Not seeing too much info on that but I will keep reading.<br>
Thank you!</p>

<p>You can set up slice views to show model or segmentation intersections and then save slices to sequence of png files using Screen Capture module.</p>

<p>Thank you.  Is there a way to do an obj import?  The help topics seems limited in this.</p>
