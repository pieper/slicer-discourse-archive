<p>Dear Slicer users,</p>
<p>I’m trying to import a 4D nifti which was created using the header shown in the attached image. I would like to import it as multi volume and sequence.</p>
<p>Right now I can import it as multi volume but, when I use the import form, the volume sequence option does not appear in the “description” list.</p>
<p>Do you know which field of the header should I change?</p>
<p>Thank you in advance.</p>

<p>If you save the MultiVolume as nrrd file then you can load it into Slicer as a volume sequence.</p>
