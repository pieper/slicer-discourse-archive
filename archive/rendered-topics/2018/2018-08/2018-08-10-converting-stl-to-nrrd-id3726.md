<p>Is there a way to convert my .stl to a .nrrd?</p>
<p>I am able to import my stl into Slicer through Import&gt;Models which supposedly creates a Segmentation (though nothing appears on the screen) and then my export segmentation options are vtm.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>You can use “Segmentations” module to export segmentation as Labelmap (“Export/import models and labelmaps” section), which you will then be able to save as NRRD.</p>
