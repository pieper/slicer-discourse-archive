<p>Hello, i am starting in Slicer and i have some trouble.<br>
I have done a cbct for implant surgery. I want to add de dcm data to slicer but when i load the 600 dcm imagins only let me see the last dcm loaded…<br>
The problem is about dcm dicom? or because is very large ?<br>
Tank you very much<br>
