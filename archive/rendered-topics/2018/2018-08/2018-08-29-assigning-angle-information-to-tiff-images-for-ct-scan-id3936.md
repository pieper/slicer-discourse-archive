<p>Hi,<br>
Fairly new to Slicer and have been given a sequence of CT images from a collegue.<br>
The Images are a list of tiffs each from at specific angle. I have the corresponding angle of each of these but I am unsure how to marry them.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>It sounds like you have just the projection images and you need to reconstruct volumes before they can be used in Slicer.</p>
<p>This tool might help: <a href="https://www.openrtk.org/">https://www.openrtk.org/</a></p>
