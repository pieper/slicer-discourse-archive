<p>I was trying to build “PlusBuild” for my NDI tracker application. I had already built slicer 4.8.1 from the source. But the Plus 2.6 failed to build in slicer 4.8.1.<br>
Does it compatible with this slicer version?<br>
Do I need to try for Plus 2.4? I think Plus-master is for latest version.</p>
