<p><a class="mention" href="/u/fedorov">@fedorov</a> I’ve noticed for some tumors that a large number of voxels are not fit making a tumor to tumor comparison difficult (example graph of a poor whole tumor fit attached). I think for some cases where the signal noise may be higher a single ROI fit may provide better results.  If possible a option to select voxel by voxel or whole ROI for a fit option would be great.</p>

<p>I completely agree it would be a very nice feature!</p>
<p>If you are a developer - would you be interested to give it a try? Your contribution would be most welcomed. I can give you pointers. I just don’t have resources to add this feature anytime soon.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I am not a developer so I don’t think I’d be much help with adding this feature. Thanks for adding the suggestion.</p>
