<p>Operating system: Windows<br>
Slicer version: 4.7</p>
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am working on a project and need to integrate an existing Visual Studio C++ project into Slicer 4.7. Would like to get help on the integration. The project is ready and we would like to pay for the help.<br>
For the details please send email to <a href="mailto:kerry.garcia0609@gmail.com">kerry.garcia0609@gmail.com</a>.<br>
Any support is greatly appreciated.<br>
Thanks,</p>
<p>Kerry</p>

<p>Hi Kerry,</p>
<p>Thanks for reaching out. On behalf of Kitware, <a class="mention" href="/u/superlib">@superlib</a> and I are interesting in working with you.</p>
<p>Out of curiosity, is there any specific reason you are targeting Slicer 4.7 instead of the latest stable version (Slicer 4.8.1) or current nighly build (Slicer 4.9) ?</p>

<p>Thanks!<br>
The only reason for Slicer 4.7 is that I have it compiled on my system already and I think the version should be enough for the project.</p>
