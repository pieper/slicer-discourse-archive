<p><em>(I know this is off-topic but <a class="mention" href="/u/lassoan">@lassoan</a> previously suggested we could post here)</em></p>
<p>We’re working on a commercial Slicer-based cardio project for analysis of 4D CT scans, with 2 Slicer developers and another developer from a VTK background, all part-time. For this project and potential future work we’re keen to have a wider pool of developers - long term we imagine we’d love someone full-time as our Slicer devs have full-time jobs (working on Slicer).</p>
<p>If you’re experienced in Slicer development, interested in work now or in the future, I’d love to hear from you (<a href="mailto:john@jdxsolutions.com">john@jdxsolutions.com</a>)</p>
<p>Thanks, and sorry to spam the list! We don’t know anywhere else to easily find Slicer developers.</p>

<p>It would be nice if there is a section in the forum for open jobs, positions, .etc related to Slicer and Medical Imaging.</p>
