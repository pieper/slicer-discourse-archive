<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>In 1995-1996, I did my 3rd year university thesis on 3D Medical Imaging. This was a program to convert slices of MRI scans to a 3D representation (IIRC I used histogram thresholding + marching cubes). I stumbled across this project today and it brought so many memories back! I was offered a research post in the field but unfortunately couldn’t take it at the time - one of my greatest regrets. At the time, I really wanted to take it further into a full blown program. So glad it exists now!</p>
<p>Best of luck with the future.</p>
