<p>Slicer version: 4.9.0</p>
<p>I want to upload an external atlas named as WHS_SD_rat_atlas_v2 for using it as a reference for brain segmentation. But when I use Em segment with atlas, there is no task defined for this purpose. When I want to create new task, there is error loading in the software. My question is how can I use this external atlas in 3D slicer for rat brain segmentation? ( All the documents are for versions 3.6)</p>
<p>Thanks for your help.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the EMSegmenter isn’t getting much support these days so maybe only the basics are working - we may remove it from the distribution soon.  You can have a look at some previous discussion that may help (like using Slicer3, but be forewarned that it’s not maintained either).</p>
