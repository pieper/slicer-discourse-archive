<p>Hi everyone,<br>
I´m currently working with a lot of integrated models inside one oblect, which is also a model. I was wondering whether you can export the axial, sagittal, and coronal view of models as volumes (for example as nrrd file or image stack…) . Because they are showing the exact edges of the models with the specific colours from every side and I need these views for another project…<br>
I would be really pleased if anyone has some experience or suggestions for me.<br>
Thank you!</p>

<p>I figured it out by myself over Screen Capture and Master view…</p>
