<p>Dear all,</p>
<p>To learn which neuroimaging data derivatives (intermediate or final analysis outputs) matter most to people conducting analyses and reusing data we have put together a survey:</p>

<p>Hello! Thank you for taking time out of your day to provide input regarding processed data outputs that are important for sharing and reusability. If you have any questions please feel free to email Franklin (ffein@stanford.edu).</p>

  <div style="clear: both"></div>
</aside>

<p>Please take a moment and fill it and most importantly share it with your colleagues - this feedback is extremely helpful and will help to focus BIDS Derivatives standardization work.</p>
<p>I know the survey is not exhaustive (for example does not include very important modalities such as EEG, MEG, iEEG or PET). I hope we will be able to perform followup surveys in the near future to fill in those gaps.</p>
<p>Best,<br>
Chris</p>
