<p>Hello. I am using the ‘Paint’ and ‘Erase’ feautres on slicer and creating a 3D model.  After painting and erasing all my slices, I click ‘Show 3D’ and I still have a few residual areas of paint on the 3D image but there is no paint on the slices. How can I get rid of these residual pieces of paint most easily? Thanks.</p>
