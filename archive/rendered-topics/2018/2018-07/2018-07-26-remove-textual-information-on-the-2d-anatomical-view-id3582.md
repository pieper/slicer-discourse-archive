<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I want to capture the 2D anatomical views in Slicer and save them in the image format such as PNG. However, there are some textual information on each 2D anatomical viewer.</p>
<p>Is there a way in Slicer to remove the textual information on the 2D anatomical view?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>D</p>

<p>In module selector choose Quantification / DataProbe and uncheck “Enable Slice View Annotations” option.</p>
