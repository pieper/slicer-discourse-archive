<p>Operating system:win10<br>
Slicer version:4.8.1<br>
Expected behavior: I use Quantitative Reporting to do the segment and label. When I save and load another patient’s dicom file, I wish the software should refresh and clear the segment I made before.<br>
Actual behavior: However it seems that the segment and the label are still there.  And if I want to refresh I must close the software and reopen it. Is there any refresh button or any other way to do that?</p>
<p>I hope you can help me,  Thank U!</p>

<p>Slicer allows you unlimited comparison of various data sets. If you only want to see one data set then close the scene before loading a new data set (hit Ctrl+W or in menu: File / Close scene) .</p>
