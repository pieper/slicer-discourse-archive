<p>Hi guys,</p>
<p>Our Chest_Imaging_Platform extension is not available in the Nightly build. I checked the CDash and everything looks fine (<a href="http://slicer.cdash.org/index.php?project=Slicer4&amp;filtercount=1&amp;showfilters=1&amp;field1=buildname&amp;compare1=63&amp;value1=Chest_Imaging_Platform">http://slicer.cdash.org/index.php?project=Slicer4&amp;filtercount=1&amp;showfilters=1&amp;field1=buildname&amp;compare1=63&amp;value1=Chest_Imaging_Platform</a>)<br>
Did anything change in the process or am I missing something?</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Jorge</p>
