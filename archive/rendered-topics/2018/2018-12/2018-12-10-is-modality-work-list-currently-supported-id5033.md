<p><a class="mention" href="/u/brian_murray">@Brian_Murray</a> Could you tell us a little about your use case? How would you like to use worklist with Slicer?<br>
There are various ways of iterating through studies, use DICOM networking to receive data, query and retrieve data using, etc., so it may be possible that your needs can be fulfilled with existing features or with not too much development work.</p>
