<p>Hi! I new in 3D Slicer. I’m not sure if it’s the appropriate category. I’m very sorry if this problem has already been resolved…</p>
<p>I need to draw two planes and measeurements the distances between them. How I can do it? And, the planes can be parallel? I am thinking in the digital caliper in the reality.</p>
<p>Thank you so much!!</p>

<p>Could you clarify what you would like to do? You cannot just “draw planes” (there are many ways to define plane position and orientation in 3D, but they are not based on drawing). Distance between planes only exist if the planes are parallel, so I don’t understand your question if the planes can be parallel.</p>
<p>Maybe you can make a step back and tell about the clinical problem that you would like to solve and that could help us understanding of what you would like to do.</p>
