<p>I am trying to compile a sequential set of histology slides into a 3D volume. Does 3D slicer have the capacity to do this? Can someone please provide me with a link to a tutorial on how to do this? Thanks!</p>

<p>Yes, you can do that. See instructions here: <a href="https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/Nightly/FAQ#How_to_load_data_from_a_sequence_of_jpg.2C_tif.2C_or_png_files.3F" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/Nightly/FAQ#How_to_load_data_from_a_sequence_of_jpg.2C_tif.2C_or_png_files.3F</a></p>
