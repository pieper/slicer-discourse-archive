<p>Operating system:Win10<br>
Slicer version:4.10.0<br>
Expected behavior:<br>
Actual behavior:Hi everyone, I exported a hollow model and realized the thickness was small a few days later. So I came back to edit that. But slices from all three dimensions stop at the first slice and I can’t scroll to view different slices. Does anyone have any idea about that? Thank you!</p>
