<p>This is exciting, our Kitware headquarter is relocating to a new building ! Worth noting that our network bandwidth will also be improved.</p>
<p>Network and servers are expected to be fully operational up until the morning of Dec. 15th. Then, some of our hosted services (e.g <a href="http://slicer.cdash.org" rel="nofollow noopener">slicer.cdash.org</a>, <a href="http://slicer.kitware.com" rel="nofollow noopener">slicer.kitware.com</a>, <a href="http://data.kitware.com" rel="nofollow noopener">data.kitware.com</a>, <a href="http://download.slicer.org" rel="nofollow noopener">download.slicer.org</a>,…) will be unavailable all day Dec. 15th while we physically move everything and complete the network cutover. We will set up a “we are moving” page warning visitors to many of our primary external web sites that we are temporarily offline for maintenance.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance for your patience,</p>
