<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I’m working on segments. I already extracted points with vtkPolyData and vtkPoints.</p>
<p>This time I would like to get points which are placed in plane X,Y or Z like a “vertical or horizontal slice” of my segment.</p>
<p>How can I do it ?</p>
<p><em>(The origin of my referentiel isn’t 0,0,0 but 1 calculated point “C”)</em></p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>What do you mean by “already extracted points” and by “get points”? I would assume that if you have extracted points then you already have them, so you don’t need to get them. What would you like to do? What is the clinical problem that you would like to solve?</p>
