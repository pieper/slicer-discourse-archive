<p>We moved the Slicer  5 roadmap page to the Labs page, there is no a roadmap section. See <a href="https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/Labs#Roadmap" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/Labs#Roadmap</a></p>
<p>We discussed how the UI and UX could be improved. Here is a very short list, we should probably create a poll or conduct a user study …</p>
<ul>
<li>Create two different applications ? Or have theme like Blender ? Simple vs Advanced</li>
<li>Collect specific list of UI issues:
<ul>
<li>user can not find the eye icon in volume rendering</li>
<li>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Display volume in 3D by default</li>
<li>Free “real estate” by hiding (or relocating) the Slicer icon ?</li>
</ul>
