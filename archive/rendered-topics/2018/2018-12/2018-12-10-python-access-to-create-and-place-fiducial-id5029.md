<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I’d like to make a keyboard shortcut for Create-And-Place Fiducial using some python in my .slicerrc as described in the Script Repository. I’m placing a lot of fiducials in some scans and taking the time to go back up and click the button actually adds up when you do it a couple hundred times a day.</p>
<p>How to I get access to the action for the toolbar button to activate the slot (or just call it directly) from python? I’ve looked through slicer.app.[…] but I’ve been unable to find it - can someone point me in the right direction?</p>
<p>Thanks a lot!!</p>
