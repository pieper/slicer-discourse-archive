<p>Is there a way to delete lines after creating them? I think there is one but I can not find it.</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>Is there a way to create circles or non-linear lines using the tool?</p>

<p>By “lines” do you mean annotation rulers? You can edit/delete them in Annotations module.</p>
<p>For circles, you need to do some custom scripting as described here: <a href="https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/Nightly/ScriptRepository#Manipulating_objects_in_the_slice_viewer">https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/Nightly/ScriptRepository#Manipulating_objects_in_the_slice_viewer</a></p>
