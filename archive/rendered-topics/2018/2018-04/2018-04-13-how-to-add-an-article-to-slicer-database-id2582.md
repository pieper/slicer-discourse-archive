<p>Hello Community!<br>
We have recently published an article and we’ve used 3D Slicer. Is there any specific Slicer database where I can upload it? It is already on Pubmed (PMID: 29197656).</p>
<p>thanks in advance,</p>
<p>gerard</p>

<p>I think you can email the PMID to the Publication database contact listed here:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.spl.harvard.edu/pages/PublicationDBHelp" class="onebox" target="_blank">https://www.spl.harvard.edu/pages/PublicationDBHelp</a></p>
<p>(Or request an account and upload yourself)</p>
