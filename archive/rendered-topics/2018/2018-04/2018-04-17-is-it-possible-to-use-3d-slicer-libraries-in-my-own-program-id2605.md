<p>Hi every one<br>
I am new to slicer so my question maybe a beginner one,<br>
I wanna use libraries of slicer in c++ to use its benefits in my image processing program.<br>
For example I wanna have an Interface like what it is available in slicer to load my images, choose my ROI edit it and … .<br>
I have built ITK, VTK, Opencv and I hope I Would combine these three libraries with 3d_Slicer together.<br>
Is it possible?</p>
