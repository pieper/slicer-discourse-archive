<p>Operating system:Windows 7<br>
Slicer version:4.2.2</p>
<p>I am doing BRAINSDemonWrap (command line), however I cannot find any output for transformation matrix, any suggestions how I could save the transformation matrix please?</p>
<p>I know we can save it if we do it manually (GUI version). Since I have a lot of files, I would like to do it in command line. Thank you.</p>

<p>anyone please? I can get the displacements, but not the matrix when I used the command line scripting. Is there any way? Thank you.</p>
