<p>I ran into an issue trying to git svn rebase/dcommit.  Alexis could also reproduce the issue.  Is anyone else seeing this?</p>

<p>Ideas how to solve?  I guess we could commit directly using svn.</p>

<p>Creating a fresh checkout works, but also just updating the references also seems to work.  See notes in the issue.</p>
