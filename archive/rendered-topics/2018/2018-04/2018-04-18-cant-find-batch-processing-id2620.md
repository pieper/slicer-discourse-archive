<p>Operating system: MACOSX high sierra<br>
Slicer version: 4.8.1<br>
Expected behavior: to click on modules and see batch processing option<br>
Actual behavior: there is no batch processing option under module list</p>
<p>Hi everyone - this is a v basic question but I’m trying to go through some batch processing tutorials. The one I’m trying to do is the Gaussian blurr for different sigma values. I cannot find any batch processing module under the module list. Supposedly batch processing was integrated starting with Slicer v3. Anyway, any help is appreciated.</p>
