<p>i want to work on osteoporosis of vertebrae so that its material properties get vary with density of bones. Is there any way to store the variation  density of bone in export model.</p>

<p>You can use “Probe volume with model” module to store intensity values of a selected volume at point data of a surface or volumetric mesh.</p>
