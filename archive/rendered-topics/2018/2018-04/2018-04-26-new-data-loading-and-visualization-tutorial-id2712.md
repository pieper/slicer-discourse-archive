<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I created an updated “Data loading and visualization” tutorial, as the one on the wiki is for Slicer 4.5, which is 3.5 years old, and there are countless things that changed since then. I primarily made this for the PerkLab Slicer Bootcamp which is next week, but as I based this on Sonia’s previous slides which I think are very good, this is only an augmentation of that workflow.</p>
<p>Added:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data module</li>
<li>Volume rendering</li>
<li>Small things (module history, rotate to volume plane, ruler, reset view, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Removed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lightboxes (it’s mainly for conservative radiologists I think)</li>
</ul>
<p>For convenience, the links:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/Nightly/Training#Slicer4_Data_Loading_and_3D_Visualization">Training page</a></li>
<li><a href="http://slicer.kitware.com/midas3/download/item/356408/20180430_DataLoadingAndVisualizationTutorial.pdf">PDF</a></li>
<li><a href="http://slicer.kitware.com/midas3/download/item/356409/20180430_DataLoadingAndVisualizationTutorial.pptx">PPTX</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If you have any comments, please let me know and I’ll try to incorporate them.</p>
