<p>Hi guys,</p>
<p>Recently, I builded Slicer on Window 10 with qt 4.8.7 and got following error.<br>
Slicer\Libs\vtkSegmentationCore\vtkBinaryLabelmapToClosedSurfaceConversionRule.cxx(28): fatal error C1083: Cannot open include file: ‘vtkDiscreteFlyingEdges3D.h’: No such file or directory [F:\S4R\Slicer-build\Libs\vtkSegmentationCore\vtkSegmentationCore.vcxproj] It seems that it is related to vtk version. Can anybody give any advice. Thanks!</p>
<p>Operating system: Win 10<br>
Slicer version: 4.9<br>
Expected behavior:<br>
Actual behavior:</p>
