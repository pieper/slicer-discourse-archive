<p>Hi Andinet,</p>
<p>I think that Dr. Xie is complaining about the use of google because google is blocked in China. He is one of the more active members of the Chinese “we talk” user group with over 2500 members.</p>

<p>I also second that making video recordings of these free workshops available would be a boon to community, especially for users who want to get more technical insight.</p>

<p>Participating at a 2-day course in person is a great learning opportunity. However, if you cannot make it, then there is online training material already available that should keep you busy for about a year:</p>
<ul>
<li>Read the <a href="https://www.vtk.org/vtk-textbook/">VTK textbook</a>, cover to cover, 2-3 times (I’m serious, read all of it; and read it several times, as in the first pass you’ll not have deep enough understanding to get all details); this is essential, don’t do anything else before you read the book completely at least once</li>
<li>Skim through <a href="https://lorensen.github.io/VTKExamples/site/">VTK examples</a>
</li>
<li>Skim through the <a href="http://www.itk.org/ItkSoftwareGuide.pdf">ITK software guide</a>, and read parts that are relevant for your tasks</li>
<li>Complete a couple of <a href="http://www.simpleitk.org/SimpleITK/help/documentation.html">SimpleITK tutorials</a>
</li>
<li>Complete a few online courses about Python and numpy</li>
<li>Complete a few online tutorials about Qt basics</li>
<li>Complete all <a href="https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/Nightly/Training">Slicer tutorials</a>
</li>
<li>If relevant for your work, complete all <a href="http://www.slicerigt.org/wp/user-tutorial/">SlicerIGT tutorials</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>I filled out the form a few days ago but haven’t received a confirmation.  Will those be going out soon?  Sorry to be a bother but this would be in the middle of a multi-country trip so need to schedule flights.</p>

<p>There will be a <a href="https://na-mic.github.io/ProjectWeek/PW28_2018_GranCanaria/">Slicer project week in Europe June 25-29</a>. There is a nominal registration fee and of course there are travel expenses, but overall may be more affordable than getting to the USA.</p>
<p>Also, there are Slicer workshops and tutorials held at major conferences (RSNA, SPIE Medical Imaging, MICCAI, …) - usually they get listed here: <a href="https://www.na-mic.org/wiki/Events">https://www.na-mic.org/wiki/Events</a>.</p>
<p>If there is enough interest - something like 20 people would like to learn about Slicer-related topics for at least a couple of hours - then it should be possible to arrange customized training course anywhere in the world.</p>

<p>I would like to attend the course. Anyhope. or any kind of vedio clips properly arranged.<br>
Is there in India or USA. Please reply. My intention is to do tractography and import and export vector or scalar images into or outside the system of Gamma Knife planning.</p>

<p>Attending a course is a convenient way of getting introduced to selected features of Slicer but there are many other ways to learn all that you need. For example, you can start with tutorials on <a href="https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/Nightly/Training">Slicer training page</a> then ask any specific question on this forum.</p>
