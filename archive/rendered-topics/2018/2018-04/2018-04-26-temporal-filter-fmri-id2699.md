<p>Operating system: win 10<br>
Slicer version: 4.9</p>
<p>Dear all,</p>
<p>Is it possible to make a temporal filter (bandpass) with Slicer ?<br>
I have fMRI sequences and I want delete hight and low  frequences.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Slicer doesn’t do much for fMRI except visualizing the results.  Probably another tool like FSL or nipy is better for what you are looking for.</p>
