<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>I assigned Fractional labelmap as Master in Representations, so I can have smooth edge when I use Fractional labelmap for Representation in 2D views. However, when I try to save the segmentation with this setting, my computer always crashes. I hope by saving the segmentation with this setting the edges will always look smooth. Maybe I am wrong.<br>
When I try to save the segmentation with Binary labelmap, everything is saved without any problem.</p>
<p>I wonder if anyone run into this issue? What is your solution to this.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
