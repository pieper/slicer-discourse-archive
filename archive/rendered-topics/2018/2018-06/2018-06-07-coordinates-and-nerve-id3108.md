<p>Operating system: window7<br>
Slicer version: 4.9.0<br>
Expected behavior:<br>
Actual behavior:</p>
<p>There are a few questions about using 3D Slicer.</p>
<ol>
<li>Can I change the coordinates of the model shown in 3Dveiwer before extracting with stl?</li>
<li>Can we match the stl model to the CT and extract the model with its coordinates?</li>
<li>Can I view the 2D viewer as a panorama? Is there a function that can extract nerve in 3D in that state?</li>
</ol>
