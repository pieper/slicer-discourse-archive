<p>Hi!</p>
<p>I have imported a series of DICOM files containing 2D MR images. These MR slices are located in the axial plane at locations -40.063mm to -0.063mm in 4mm intervals. I want to reslice this series to have slicelocations at xx.466mm in 1mm intervals and then export it as a new 2D DICOM series. Is this possible?</p>
<p>Many thanks in advance!!</p>
