<p>Hello,<br>
Is there an usual way and examples in Slicer (using python) to add color maps to image slices and volume reconstructions?. I’ve found something similar to what I’d like do in a previous NA-MIC project week description: <a href="https://na-mic.org/wiki/File:Sivic_slicer_slc_mets.jpg" rel="nofollow noopener">https://na-mic.org/wiki/File:Sivic_slicer_slc_mets.jpg</a>  (from <a href="https://na-mic.org/wiki/2011_Winter_Project_Week:MRSI_module_and_SIVIC_interface" rel="nofollow noopener">https://na-mic.org/wiki/2011_Winter_Project_Week:MRSI_module_and_SIVIC_interface</a>), but no code seems to available. Thank you very much.</p>

<p>Hi Francisco - I hope the discussions at Project Week helped get you on the right track for this.  Creating a scalar volume with a custom color table would the a good way to go for this.  Feel free to post any follow up questions.</p>
<p>Best,<br>
