<p>I’m using the OpenIGTlink extension to acquire a transform from a server in real time.<br>
In some picture I saw that the locator has a lite blu needle shape, but in my case it appears to me as a cube with 9 points, 8 on the edges and one in the centre that correspond to the position sent by the server.<br>
How can i change the shape of the locator into the lite blu needle one?</p>

<p>Sorry, maybe i was not completely clear.<br>
I want to change the way that the locator is visualized. Actually when i send a transform in real-time, this is tracked by a locator model that appears to me as a cube.<br>
I would prefer another model for the locator, not the cubic one. There is a way to change it? Becuase i’m searching since one week but i found nothing.<br>
Thanks to who will reply.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.slicerigt.org/wp/user-tutorial/">SlicerIGT tutorials</a> explain in great detail how you can display tracked tools in Slicer. Tutorials also explain calibration of different tool types, usage of references, how to register patient/phantom images to the tracker’s coordinate system, etc.</p>
