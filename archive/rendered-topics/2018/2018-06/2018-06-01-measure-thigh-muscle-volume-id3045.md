<p>Dear Steve<br>
I would like to consult you about the best method to measure thigh muscle volume, I’ve used, segment editor&gt;&gt; threshold &gt;&gt; then try to correct the error. would you advice me the better approach, or is my method  good? part of my PhD study involves muscle measurement comparing 2 visits. thanks</p>
<p>best regards<br>

<p>Is there any particular aspect of the segmentation that you would like to improve (reduce effort, increase accuracy, eliminate certain kind of errors)?</p>
