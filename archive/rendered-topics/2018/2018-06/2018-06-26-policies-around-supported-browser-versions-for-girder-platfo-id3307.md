<p>Since the upcoming extension manager is <a href="https://discourse.slicer.org/t/slicer-extension-manager-user-interface-feedback/2475">being built</a> using <a href="http://girder.readthedocs.io/">Girder</a> platform, I wanted to share with you their request for feedback.</p>
<p>The Girder team is requesting feedback from stakeholders to help form policies around supported browser versions.</p>
<p>If you’re a user or administrator of a Girder instance and want to give your input, feel free to leave it on our discourse topic:<br>
<a href="https://discourse.girder.org/t/feedback-browser-support/135" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://discourse.girder.org/t/feedback-browser-support/135</a></p>
<p>Also, for Girderi who are interested, the Girder team will be making use of the Announcements category on our discourse for this sort of thing going forward: <a href="https://discourse.girder.org/c/announcements" class="inline-onebox">Announcements - Girder</a>.</p>
