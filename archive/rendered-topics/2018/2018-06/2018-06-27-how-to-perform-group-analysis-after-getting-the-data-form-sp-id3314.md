<p>Dear experts:<br>
I have performed the analysis of SPHARM-PDM 3D-slicer4.8 using the ShapeAnalysis_Data_Example in MCA_OS. But I can’t find any valid tool to go on comparing these two groups in slicer of MAC_OS, and I don’t know what to do! Can you help me! I am beginner to SPHARM-PDM in MAC_OS. Many thanks in advance!</p>
