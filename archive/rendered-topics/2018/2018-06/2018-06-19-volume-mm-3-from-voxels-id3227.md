<p>Please may i know Why the volume statistics from the segment statistics take volume as<br>
volume = no. of voxels * pixellength * pixelwidth * slicethickness*  2         and not<br>
volume = no. of voxels * pixellength * pixelwidth * slicethickness</p>
<p>Is there anything i am missing while calculating volume from voxels (only slicethickness or something else to be considered )</p>
