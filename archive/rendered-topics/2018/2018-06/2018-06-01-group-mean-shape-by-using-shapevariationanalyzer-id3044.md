<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am using shapeVariationAnalyzer module to compute the mean shape of some 3D triangulated hippocampus surfaces. Inputs are proper vtk mesh files. The module works without raising any error, however, the output is a corrupted triangulation. Do you have any idea why this happens?</p>
<p>An example of the input meshes is given here (<a href="https://ibb.co/jdUVnd" rel="nofollow noopener">https://ibb.co/jdUVnd</a>)<br>
Output mesh is given here (<a href="https://ibb.co/mcsGSd" rel="nofollow noopener">https://ibb.co/mcsGSd</a>)</p>
<p>Thank you in advance,<br>
Hamed</p>
