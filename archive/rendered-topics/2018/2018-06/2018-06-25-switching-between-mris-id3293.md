<p>Im a new user of the program and I can segment tumors / find the volumes, but I am having trouble when it comes to switching to the next MRI. How do I switch to a new MRI and keep the original segmented tumor with the corresponding original MRI, while making a new hierarchy for the new MRI/tumor segmentation? Any videos or documentation on this topic would be appreciated.</p>
