<p>Hi<br>
Dear developers and users</p>
<p>I have question about “DVH Comparison” module. I can select “DVH 1” and “DVH 2” in the panel of this module, but I do not know the role of “Dose Volume” option in this panel.<br>
What is the role of option “Dose Volume” in the module of “DVH Comparison”?</p>
<p>Please guide me,<br>
Thanks a lot.<br>
Shahrokh</p>

<p>The dose volume is the dose distribution 3D image that you used when creating the DVHs. It is used to determine the maximum dose which the dose agreement percentage criterium is based on.</p>
