<p>What did you do exactly? Describe each click that you did while you were in Crop volume module.<br>
What did you expect to happen? What happened instead?</p>

<p>I’ve removed all unwanted body part&gt;&gt; segment editor&gt;&gt;threshould effect&gt;&gt; segment statstics.</p>
<p>I’ve expected just volume measurement as it is only one continuous part.<br>
the thing happened: 2 volume measurements with exact number + mean, min,max, st deviation.<br>
do these mean the percentage of error as I’ve not corrected the threshold effect?</p>
<p>thanks</p>

<p>How did you do it?<br>
You gave the title “Crop volume does not work” to this topic. Do you have any problem with volume cropping?</p>

<p>If you get additional measurements that you don’t need then feel free to ignore them. You’ve already asked meaning of the additional metric in <a href="https://discourse.slicer.org/t/mean-st-deviation-segment-statistics/4451">this post</a>, so you’ll get an answer there.</p>
