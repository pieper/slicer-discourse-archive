<p>Hello!</p>
<p>I have just got ct images and I am tring to achieve stl model in Slicer. Unfortunately there is a lot of artifacts and I don’t know how to make clear model. Do you have some program which could help me improve quality of my images?</p>

<p><a href="https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/Nightly/Training#Slicer4_Image_Segmentation">Segment editor tutorials and recipes</a> should help in creating good quality STL files. You may need to work harder if the input CT image is of low quality (low-resolution, noisy, etc.).</p>
