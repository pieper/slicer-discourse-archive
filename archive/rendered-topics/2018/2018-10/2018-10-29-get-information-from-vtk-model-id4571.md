<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am trying to get information from a vtk model that I load at Slicer. More specifically I have a vtk model, (two cylinders) that I import it at Slicer and I want to find the center of each one in RAS. Is there any module/way that can be helpful?</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>
Eleni</p>

<p>See this topic about how to compute “center” of a model/segment: <a href="https://discourse.slicer.org/t/get-center-of-gravity-of-a-segment/4287/15?u=lassoan">Get center of gravity of a segment</a></p>

<p>Thanks, that works as fine!<br>
What if I want to get the orientation of the cylinders?</p>
