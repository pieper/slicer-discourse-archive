<p>As a neuroscientist I don’t typically work with MRI images.  I would like to know what data format I should obtain from the MR technician who runs the mouse brain MRI.  He sent me 12 Dicom images but when I load those into Slicer I get very limited 3D volumes.  What is the optimal data format that can be uploaded to Slicer so I can perform brain region volumetric analyses?</p>

<p>DICOM images is what you want. However, 12 slices sounds very few for volumetric mouse brain scans. Make sure he gives you the full stack. Or have him reconstruct the scan at higher resolution (if possible).</p>
