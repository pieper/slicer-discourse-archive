<p>Hi<br>
I’ve downloaded and worked on both versions 4.8 and 4.9, but I’ve recognized that version 4.9 not in your download page and the nightly version for mac ox is 4.11. that means version 4.9 not okay?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Now that we released Slicer 4.10, the nightly build as been updated from 4.9 to 4.11.</p>
<p>To differentiate stable release for development build, we used different version.</p>
