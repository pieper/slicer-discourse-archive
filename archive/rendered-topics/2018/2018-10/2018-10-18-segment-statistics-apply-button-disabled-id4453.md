<p>Problem report for Slicer 4.8.1 macosx-amd64: [please describe expected and actual behavior]</p>
<p>expected behavior: segment statistics apply icon active after changed parameter set.</p>
<p>actual behavior: I need to close an reopen the programme to activate the apply icon in segment statistics.</p>
<p>I need to continue using this version 4.8 as it is stable and I have started my data analysis whit it.</p>

<p>Thank you for reporting this. We will not release any patches for 4.8.1, so you can either keep using this old version and use workarounds, switch to nightly build 4.9.x, or switch to new stable version 4.10 (due within a few days).</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am new to Slicer and currently using version 4.10.2. I  also have a problem with the the apply button on the segmentation statistics module. It is not letting me select a segmentation for some reason. I have quit the programme and re-opened but it is still not working. What should I do?<br>
