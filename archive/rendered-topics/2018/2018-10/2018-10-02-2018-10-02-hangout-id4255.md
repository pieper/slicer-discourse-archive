<p>Summary of the discussion</p>
<ul>
<li>Re-targeting Slicer issue <a href="https://issues.slicer.org/view.php?id=4416">#4416</a>
</li>
<li>We will update VTK version check if version change is not reverted in upstream VTK. See <a href="https://public.kitware.com/pipermail/vtk-developers/2018-October/036406.html">https://public.kitware.com/pipermail/vtk-developers/2018-October/036406.html</a>
</li>
<li>DataStore:
<ul>
<li>The datastore was initially implemented by copying code from the extension manager and require some work to use same base classes</li>
<li>We will post on discourse asking if anyone is actively using the DataStore as part of their workflow, if not we will add a section to the SampleData module with links to the Atlases and the Registration cases</li>
<li>Talked about <a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/data-types/dataset">https://developers.google.com/search/docs/data-types/dataset</a>   and discussed how synergy with effort like <a href="https://www.morphosource.org/">https://www.morphosource.org/</a> could be established so that Slicer dataset can be shared and discovered.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
