<p>Anyone interested in segmentation should have a look at <a href="http://openanatomy.org">openanatomy.org</a> for freely available 3D models and a cool web viewer:  <a href="https://www.openanatomy.org//">https://www.openanatomy.org//</a></p>
<p>Most of the atlas data was created in Slicer, and of course people with segmentation-related skills are encouraged to consider contributing to the project.</p>
<p>Also note that on the website there’s a <a href="https://briihub.polldaddy.com/s/brightfutures2018">link to a page</a> where you can vote for the <a href="http://openanatomy.org">openanatomy.org</a> for possible funding, so please vote if you like the project.</p>
