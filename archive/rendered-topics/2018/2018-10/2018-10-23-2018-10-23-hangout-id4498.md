<p>Brief minutes</p>
<ul>
<li>Discussed remaining 4.10 issue: signing the Mac package</li>
<li>This <a href="https://github.com/Slicer/Slicer/pull/1029" rel="nofollow noopener">PR</a> - discussed naming conventions for functions that do multiple tasks (i.e create AND observe vs. create).  No real consensus yet, discussion is ongoing.  We probably want to avoid introducing breaking name changes without good reason.</li>
<li>More thoughts and discussion on QtWebEngine! <a class="mention" href="/u/pieper">@pieper</a> will be attending a Qt event in the next few weeks, and will try to get some info to help us decide if we are keeping/chucking.</li>
</ul>
