<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am having an issue with opening DICOM files. It seems that the data I have is separated out into different series, like T2 coronal and T2 Sag so when I important a file only that specific view is high resolution, the other views appear to be very low quality.</p>
<p>Is there a way to import each file at once or combine these into one file?</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>
