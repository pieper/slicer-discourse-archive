<p><a class="mention" href="/u/jcfr">@jcfr</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/sam_horvath">@Sam_Horvath</a> our SlicerDMRI extension is not building on linux (metroplex) since 2018-10-05. Can you investigate please? There is no entry at all on the dashboard for the next days (but it is building on vasstbuild). Thanks.</p>
