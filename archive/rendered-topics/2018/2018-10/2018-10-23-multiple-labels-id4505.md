<p>Operating system:MacOs<br>
Slicer version:1.0.0<br>
Expected behavior:generate SPHARM from multiple labels<br>
Actual behavior:</p>
<p>Hi,<br>
I would like to create one SPHARM-model from multiple lables (Hippocampus, 3 lables for head, body, tail). So far, I can only choose one label numer. Is there a possibility to include all 3 labels to generate the model or are you aware of a workaround?<br>
Thanks so much, Georg</p>
