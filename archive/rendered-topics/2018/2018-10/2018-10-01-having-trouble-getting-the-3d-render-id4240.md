<p>Hello.<br>
I just discovered slicer for using fetus dcm files to stl and than print.<br>
I found the video on youtube. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHq0uyDvhaA" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHq0uyDvhaA</a>    Downloaded the same files. But i have a different screen not the same at the video. I have a gaming laptop. İ7 7700 with a gtx 1070 8gb gpu. when i do the first step nothing happens. at first i was trying to do cpu rendering, slicer was collapsing. than see the option of gpu but nothing happens. all blank.  what must i do ?</p>
<p>thank you.</p>
