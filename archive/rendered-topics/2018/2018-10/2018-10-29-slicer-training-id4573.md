<p>Hi Julien,</p>
<p>Thank you for organizing this training programme.  Unfortunately I am unable to participate but do you have any other options please.</p>
<p>I am an orthopaedic surgical fellow in Australia, and I use slicer a lot for my research work. I d like to be able to do simple  python scripts to facilitate my work. apart from tutorials ( I ve gone through almost everything relevant to me) are there any online courses/ webinars etc. I have no programming knowledge ( I am training to become a surgeon) but keen to be able to do simple scripts.</p>
<p>At the moment I am manually transferring 800 numbers one by one foe each of my scans, ( tracking data) from slicer to excel because I do not know how to do a script in Python.</p>
<p>Your advice is much appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>Kind regards</p>
<p>Melanie</p>

<p>You may want to create a new topic on Discourse, explain a bit more your need and ask for some guidelines.</p>

<p>Hi <a class="mention" href="/u/melanie">@Melanie</a> -</p>
<p>You might look into ResBaz - there have been some good Slicer training resources there and the organizers would probably appreciate feedback about your research interests: <a href="https://resbaz.github.io/resbaz2018/">https://resbaz.github.io/resbaz2018/</a></p>
<p>I agree with <a class="mention" href="/u/finetjul">@finetjul</a> that posting a problem statement on discourse could also help.</p>
<p>Best,<br>
Steve</p>
