<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Does anyone have experience with exporting a segmented model from 3D Slicer to ABAQUS for mesh creation and finite element analysis?<br>
Would greatly appreciate any tips and advice (for example, regarding file formats, any limitations, how to make the process easier).</p>
<p>Thank you so much!</p>

<p>There is no simple answer. Read this topic: <a href="https://discourse.slicer.org/t/use-segmentations-in-cad-or-fem-software/1626">Use segmentations in CAD or FEM software</a>, and if you still have questions then post them here.</p>
