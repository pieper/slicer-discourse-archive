<p>Operating system: Mac OS High Sierra<br>
Slicer version: 4.7</p>
<p>I am a total beginner with the Slicer IGT toolkit.<br>
I would like to develop a neuronavigation method for use in veterinary medicine based on 3DSlicer.<br>
My plan was to use 3 infrared cameras (Optitrack V120:Trio) for the tracking hardware.<br>
Before I invest in this, I was wondering if anyone had any experience with it or have any other alternative suggestions?</p>
<p>Any advice would be much appreciated.</p>

<p>We’ve been using Optitrack Duo for surgical navigation experiments quite extensively in the past year or so and it works very well. Its accuracy is comparable to expensive NDI Polaris optical tracker, which is used in BrainLab and Medtronic surgical navigation systems.</p>
<p>Optitrack Trio is probably even more accurate than Duo and may have slightly less line-of-sight issues due to the additional camera. If large size and somewhat higher price is not a problem for you then it makes sense to go with the Trio.</p>
