<p>Hello Slicer Developers,</p>
<p>I would like to tackle some improvements to the markups module. This was discussed in the thread:<br>
<a href="https://discourse.slicer.org/t/a-users-proposal-for-markups-module-enhancements/">https://discourse.slicer.org/t/a-users-proposal-for-markups-module-enhancements/</a></p>
<p>Before I jump in I would like to see if anyone has been working in this area or has other feedback. The issues I’d like to address first are:<br>
○ Landmarks sticking and sliding on surface<br>
○ One click 3D angle, length measurements from LMs.<br>
○ SA/Volume measurements through segment editor.<br>
○ Read a template for LM names, sequence<br>
○ Fine control for LM placement</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Sara, apologies for off-topic, but I can’t see a DM option. Were you at NeuroVista? If so, quite a coincidence to see you here!<br>

<p><a class="mention" href="/u/smrolfe">@smrolfe</a> this is great to hear!  I’m sure <a class="mention" href="/u/lassoan">@lassoan</a> will chime in.  It might be time to start a <a href="https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/Labs">labs page</a> to keep notes.</p>

<p>Thanks <a class="mention" href="/u/pieper">@pieper</a>, I’ve created a new labs page, <a href="https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/Labs/Improving_Markups" rel="nofollow noopener">Improving Markups</a> to start documenting this.</p>

<p>Great. I made some changes and additions to it as well.</p>

<p>These are all good features to develop. I don’t think any of these features are implemented.</p>
<p>I have design ideas for some of them, so if you decide to start working on one then start a discussion here (or in a new topic).</p>
