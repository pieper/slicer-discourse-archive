<p>Ditto on the good work finalizing the release!</p>
<p>In addition to talking about future documentation methods, if you have time on the agenda, maybe you and others can revisit the discussion about a potential transition to Github issue tracking as well. This period after a release is probably a good time to revisit this topic. I posted a <a href="https://discourse.slicer.org/t/update-of-slicer-issue-tracker/437/8?u=jamesobutler">comment</a> yesterday based on my recent experience using Mantis.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Meeting notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/smrolfe">@smrolfe</a> joined us and asked question related to <a href="https://discourse.slicer.org/t/markups-module-enhancements/4335/2" class="inline-onebox">Markups Module enhancements - #2 by danagood</a></p>
<ul>
<li>from <a class="mention" href="/u/lassoan">@lassoan</a>:
<ul>
<li>For each handle, an actor is created. We work well up to 100th of points. For thousand of points, the handle widget approach doesn’t scale well.</li>
<li>We are working on a revamped infrastructure but this is not ready. In the mean time, implementing small improvements is the way to go. Then, we can still integrate the approach into the updated infrastructure.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>documentation</p>
<ul>
<li>“restrict” lfs upload for documentation. Probably only the "/docs/ folder. See <a href="https://github.com/Slicer/Slicer/pull/686" class="inline-onebox">EM Segmenter not usable after closing a scene with EMSegmenter node · Issue #686 · Slicer/Slicer · GitHub</a></li>
<li><a class="mention" href="/u/lassoan">@lassoan</a> will try Git lfs and help answer questions like “We image be uploaded though the web interface and automatically added to Git LFS”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Transition to GitHub</p>
<ul>
<li>(1) we plan on creating an other repository (e.g Slicer-Archive ) that would have the unmodified history for future reference.</li>
<li>(2) we will move current data files to <a href="http://data.kitware.com">data.kitware.com</a> and other mirror to allow content-addressable download.</li>
<li>(3) we will trim the current Slicer/Slicer repo to remove large data. See <a href="https://gist.github.com/jcfr/93fe51974d9db8ef55a6d3172c1de68d">list of 350th largest files</a>  (generated using <a href="https://gist.github.com/jcfr/4348af13d2c8931daeab4ff9ab73e14b">this script</a>)</li>

<ul>
<li>Transition Issue tracker:
<ul>
<li>after transitioning to GitHub (see above), new issues will be added to GitHub and user will be cased to do so.</li>
<li>existing issue would be manually “transferred” to GitHub on a case-by-case.</li>
<li>we would not spend time migrating existing issues.</li>

<p>Regarding using git-lfs for documentation:</p>
<p>I’ve done some tests - see details here: <a href="https://discourse.slicer.org/t/should-we-use-git-lfs-to-manage-data/2448/13?u=lassoan">Should we use Git LFS to manage data?</a></p>
<p>In summary: git-lfs is not fully supported by GitHub web interface (for example, cannot upload git-lfs file trough web interface) and still not very robust (may break due to user errors, symlinks, merges, changing of git attributes, etc.).</p>
<p><strong>Short term:</strong> I think we should not start using git-lfs now. Instead, we can store large documentation files (mainly screenshot files) as regular files. If we keep image sizes small then the repository size will remain manageable.</p>
<p><strong>Long term:</strong> If we find that repository has become too large (not very likely to happen within a couple of years) then we can decide to move existing files to git-lfs or other solution that will be a state-of-the-art then. There is already a git-lfs command that can convert existing files to git-lfs files, so we could easily migrate any time we decide to do so.</p>

<p>Thanks for the detailed report, very insightful</p>
<blockquote>

<p>What should be threshold ?</p>
<p>This script could be helpful to answer: <a href="https://gist.github.com/jcfr/4348af13d2c8931daeab4ff9ab73e14b" class="inline-onebox">Shell script listing the N largest file found in the history of a git-versioned project · GitHub</a></p>
<p>And here is the output from that same script from few months ago: <a href="https://gist.github.com/jcfr/93fe51974d9db8ef55a6d3172c1de68d" class="inline-onebox">List of the 350 largest files committed into Slicer Git history based of Slicer/Slicer@27109 mapping to r27109 from 2018-03-26 · GitHub</a></p>

</aside>
<p>Instead of setting a size threshold, we should probably specify recommended image size, file format, and compression setting, which produces optimal images for online documentation. I guess an images would end up being a few hundred KB.</p>

</aside>
<p>That is a great idea.</p>
<p>That said I still think having a test running that would fail if un-compressible data files are above X kb (e.g 250kb)  would still be complementary.</p>
<p>It looks there are online services to compress images (<a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=online+compress+image" class="inline-onebox">online compress image at DuckDuckGo</a>), we could re command one that support copy/paste of images and allow to set its parameter from a URL.</p>
<p>Or host a javascript based one on a webpage we control.</p>

<p>Precommit hook with a file size limit would help in reducing chance of accidentally committing large files. Ultimately, it would be quality-checked manually when the pull request is merged.</p>

</aside>
<p>Since I anticipate the documentation will be updated directly on GitHub in some case, I think in addition of the pre-commit hook, we should also have a pull-request check is still relevant.</p>
<p>The good news,  is that with GitHub apps … these are now quite easy to setup. See <a href="https://probot.github.io/apps/">https://probot.github.io/apps/</a> , <a href="https://probot.github.io/docs/">https://probot.github.io/docs/</a> and <a href="https://github.com/gr2m/github-app-example" class="inline-onebox">GitHub - gr2m/github-app-example</a></p>
<p>(no more need to host our own app on heroky like we do for the doxygen hooks, <a href="https://github.com/Slicer/github-circleci-trigger" class="inline-onebox">GitHub - Slicer/github-circleci-trigger: A simple GitHub post-receive web hook handler able to trigger a CircleCI build.</a>)</p>
