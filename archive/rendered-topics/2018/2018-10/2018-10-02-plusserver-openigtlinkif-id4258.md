<p>Downloaded nightly builds of Plus and Slicer using Windows 64bit. Need paper marker tracking so I selected “optical marker tracker using MMF video.”</p>
<p>I’m trying to use my built-in webcam but cant get it to work and keep getting “connection failed”</p>
<p>What are the steps to fix this?</p>

<p>Hardware connections must be established successfully in Plus before you can receive anything in Slicer. If you have problems with this then please it in <a href="https://github.com/PlusToolkit/PlusLib/issues/">Plus toolkit’s issue tracker</a>. If you see data showing up in Slicer and you have problems using or visualizing the data then please we are happy to help here.</p>
