<p>There is a Sample Data module included with Slicer.  There is a notice that the “CTA Abdomen (Panoramix)” is only for research and teaching purposes and not for comercial purposes. Can anyone elaborate on the status of the other datasets?</p>
<p>I was wondering if MRHead or any of the others are public domain like these: (<a href="https://graphics.stanford.edu/data/voldata/" rel="nofollow noopener">https://graphics.stanford.edu/data/voldata/</a>)</p>

<p>The panoramix is from the <a href="https://www.osirix-viewer.com/resources/dicom-image-library/">osirix samples</a>, and yes, those are restricted.</p>
<p>Unless otherwise noted the other Slicer SampleData should be available according to the data contribution sections of the <a href="https://github.com/Slicer/Slicer/blob/master/License.txt">Slicer License</a> which lets you do pretty much anything with them.  For sure the MRHead is under the Slicer License.</p>
<p>Thanks for checking.</p>
