<p>Operating system:Windows 10</p>
<p>Slicer version: 4.9.0</p>
<p>Expected behavior: Install virtual reality extension either through extension manager or manually from file</p>
<p>Actual behavior: VR extension is missing in the extension manager ,<br>
I found the extension on github but slicer refuses to install it “from file” - Gives error “No extension description found in archive”</p>
<p>I don’t have experience with python but I can read it and mostly understand<br>
Hoping someone has somewhat of an easy way to install the extension without compiling the entire program.<br>
The Developer guide.md has some sort of instructions but pretty hard to decipher what it says exactly.</p>
<p>IE: Modifying an .ini file or running a .bat or .exe file</p>

<p>You can now <a href="https://download.slicer.org/">download Slicer-4.10</a>. For this version, SlicerVirtualReality extension is available in the extension manager.</p>
