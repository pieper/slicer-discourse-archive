<p>Dear Admins<br>
This is Negareh. I am PhD candidate in Optometry and Vision Sciences. I want to know if it is possible to do the segmentation with 3D Slicer software on Optovue OCT choroidal images? I want to measure the choroidal layers thickness.<br>
i would be so grateful if you help me.</p>
<p>yours sincerely</p>

<p>There have been some OCT images that Slicer could read without problems, while others have turned out to be more complicated. The best would be to try it on a few sample images.</p>
