<p>Slicer Jupyter notebooks can now be run interactively in your web browser without the need to install Slicer on your computer - Slicer instance is launched in the cloud automatically when you open a notebook. Thanks <a class="mention" href="/u/ihnorton">@ihnorton</a> for setting this up!</p>

<p>Let us know if you find good use cases or further ideas about how we should improve this infrastructure.</p>

<p>Nice!</p>
<p>Maybe we can migrate example scripts and tutorials to this.</p>

<p>I’ve tried to do something like that in <a href="https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/lassoan/SlicerNotebooks/master?filepath=My%20first%20Slicer%20notebook.ipynb">My first notebook</a>. I think it looks promising.</p>
<p>Should we create a repository in Slicer organization? What should be the name? SlicerNotebooks? SlicerExamples? SlicerScriptRepository (if we were to migrate all contents)?</p>

<p>SlicerNotebooks makes sense to me.  Yes, I saw your example notebooks and they worked nicely for me.</p>

<p>We can also include notebooks as part of Slicer documentation (that can be launched on Binder by a single click) - see for example here: <a href="https://sphinx-gallery.github.io/auto_examples/plot_seaborn.html#sphx-glr-download-auto-examples-plot-seaborn-py">https://sphinx-gallery.github.io/auto_examples/plot_seaborn.html#sphx-glr-download-auto-examples-plot-seaborn-py</a></p>
