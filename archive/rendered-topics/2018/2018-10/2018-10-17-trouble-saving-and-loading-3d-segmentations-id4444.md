<p>Operating system: Windows 10 64 bit<br>
Slicer version: 4.7.0<br>
Expected behavior: I should be able to load my previous segmentations in slicer.<br>
Actual behavior: I am currently making 3d segmentations of fish muscles. This process takes a while and cannot be done in one sitting. Therefore, I often need to close out of the app and open later to continue work on my project. If I create a segmentation and save it, the 3d representation does not load when I load the saved data. How do I avoid losing all my work with segmentations every time I quit slicer?</p>

<p>You need to use a more recent version of Slicer. At least Slicer-4.8.1, but preferably a recent Slicer-4.9.x version or Slicer-4.10 (to be released within a few days).</p>
