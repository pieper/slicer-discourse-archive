<p>SlicerIGT tutorial U05- Command Line Interface has an issue. I tried several times as it has been mentioned about “EditSeqMetafile”. But there is no such file in the PlusServer bin folder.</p>
<p>Correction: “EditSequenceFile”</p>

<p>You are correct. The executable in the Plus toolkit is now called EditSequenceFile.exe.</p>
<p>On the SlicerIGT website it says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that this course will remain under constant development. If you notice any mistakes, or have any suggestions on how to improve it, please  <strong><a href="http://www.slicerigt.org/wp/contact/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">contact us</a></strong> .</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You might want to go through that contact since it is probably a more direct way for requesting the tutorial to be updated.</p>

<p>SlicerIGT tutorial U05 and associated .bat files in SlicerIGT-Data have now been updated to use the new name (EditSequenceFile).</p>
