<p>Operating system: Mac Os<br>
Slicer version: 4.8.1</p>
<p>I am trying to use DWIConvert to convert nrrd to nii (–conversionMode NrrdToFSL) on the data that were previously preprocessed by DTIPrep (before that I successfully converted them from nii to nrrd), but I am receiving the error message “Segmentation fault: 11”. Any idea what went wrong?</p>
<p>Best</p>
