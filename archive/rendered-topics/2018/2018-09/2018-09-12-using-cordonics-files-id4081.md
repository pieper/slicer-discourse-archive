<p>Operating system: Windows 10<br>
Slicer version:4.8.1<br>
Expected behavior: import files<br>
Actual behavior: unable to select top folder</p>
<p>I am trying to load files from Cordonics and when I select the top level folder the ‘import’ button doesn’t activate.  It could be because if i load outside of 3d slicer I am prompted for a password and 3d slicer can’t recognise it?</p>
<p>I tried copying files manually to my laptop but all the files in each sub folder have the same name so it is a nightmare.</p>
<p>Then tried loading just one folder and it goes through the process and then says complete but 0 on everything.</p>

<p>Can you explain what Cordonics is?</p>
<p>Also what kind of data you expect to find (for example do you expect some kind of dicom files?)</p>

<p>Hi, it is a CT scan viewer.  I have found a work round by copying each directory to my laptop from the cd and then import from there.  Not ideal but it works, thank you.</p>
