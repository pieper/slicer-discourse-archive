<p>Operating system: Windows<br>
Slicer version: 4.8.1</p>
<p>Hi I’m new to developing with 3D slicer and I want to know if it’s possible to create a module that does not stop running, that is, keeps running in the background while I use the module. If so, any tip on how that works?</p>

<p>Few questions:</p>
<p>Do you mean keeps running after you switch to another module?<br>
Do you mean runs a process in another thread?<br>
Do you mean runs a recurring function (aka, driven by a timer?)</p>
