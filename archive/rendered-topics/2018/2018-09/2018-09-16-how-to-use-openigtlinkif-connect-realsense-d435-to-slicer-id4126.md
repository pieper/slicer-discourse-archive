<p>A video demo posted by  PerkLab on YouTube  about connecting slicer to the Intel RealSense cameras to receive registered optical image:</p>
<div class="lazyYT" data-youtube-id="W0NmrT4Z8go" data-youtube-title="Real-time depth and image data in 3D Slicer" data-width="480" data-height="270" data-parameters="feature=oembed&amp;wmode=opaque"></div>
<p>I  googled tutorials, but most tutorials are about tracking system, nothing help. would you guys please shed some light on this and give a brief tutorial ?</p>

<p>RealSense device can be connected to Slicer via <a>Plus toolkit</a>. It is just yet another imaging device, so any tutorial that includes any imaging device is applicable. See specification of RealSense-specific options and example configuration file that was used for creating the referenced youtube video is available in <a href="http://perk-software.cs.queensu.ca/plus/doc/nightly/user/DeviceIntelRealSense.html">Plus toolkit’s user manual</a>.</p>
