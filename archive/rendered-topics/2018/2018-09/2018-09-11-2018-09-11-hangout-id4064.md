<p>Sorry, was in another meeting.  Can host hangout if needed.  Perhaps we can discuss some of the pending issues for QtWebEngine fixes?</p>

<p>It would be interesting to hear about QtWebEngine, there is also some other topics to discuss - documentation, volume rendering, dashboard issues.</p>

<ul>
<li>QtWebEngine:
<ul>
<li>clicking of external links do not generate any signals; right-click and selecting “follow link” works</li>
<li>window is sometimes too large and buttons in the bottom are not visible</li>
<li>extension install may take very long time to complete</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Dashboard: PathReconstruction extension is not built on Windows: see <a href="http://slicer.cdash.org/index.php?project=SlicerPreview&amp;filtercount=1&amp;showfilters=1&amp;field1=buildname&amp;compare1=63&amp;value1=PathReconstruction">dashboard</a>; it <a href="https://github.com/SlicerIGT/SlicerPathReconstruction/blob/master/CMakeLists.txt">depends on</a> SlicerIGT, SlicerRT, MarkupsToModel extensions. Maybe it’s the long-standing issue of extensions are not being built on Windows if any of the dependencies have failing tests.</li>
</ul>
