<p>when I register my multivolume dicom data (loaded as a sequence) I cannot go beyond 20-25 frames at once , it always send a 'internal error ’ message. Any advice please. Thanks a lot</p>
<p>Also I could get RAS coordinates for points marked on different frames record them into excel. but having repeated exactly the same steps I get the RAS coordinates on mark up module (And they are changing with moving frame) but when I send to excel or past on to excel the coordinates remain the same although the frame is moved.</p>
<p>I ve installed the 26/09 nightly version . (before I had late Aug nightly version and could do this)</p>
<p>Thanks for your advice</p>
