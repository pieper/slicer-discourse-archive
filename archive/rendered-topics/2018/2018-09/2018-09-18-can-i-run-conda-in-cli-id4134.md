<p>You can run any executable in using Python as you would normally do. If you don’t use Slicer’s Python then it is probably better to use the original startup environment and not Slicer’s working environment. See details here: <a href="https://discourse.slicer.org/t/subprocess-call-in-python-interpreter-results-in-memory-corruption/919/15?u=lassoan">Subprocess call in Python interpreter results in memory corruption</a></p>

<p>You can get VMTK by installing SlicerVMTK extension.</p>
