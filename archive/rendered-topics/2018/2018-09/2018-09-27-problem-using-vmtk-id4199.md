<p>Hello everyone,<br>
I’m trying to use VMTK to create a model of some blood vessel from an MRI study but even though I’ve seen and tested with all the tutorials that I found I still do not get anything.<br>
Does anyone know what I’m doing wrong? I leave you a capture.<br>
Thank you very much!<a href="https://gyazo.com/7ddd092ed47580b2e0871fdae818e8b1" rel="nofollow noopener">https://gyazo.com/7ddd092ed47580b2e0871fdae818e8b1</a></p>

<p>What do you do exactly? What do you expect to happen? What happens instead?</p>
