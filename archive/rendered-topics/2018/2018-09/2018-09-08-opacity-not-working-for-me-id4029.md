<p>Operating system: Ubuntu 18.04.1 running in VBox on Windows 10<br>
Slicer version: 4.8.1<br>
Expected behavior: Opacity should work<br>
Actual behavior: Trying to follow the 4 min tutorial. Works well until setting the opacity for skin. Just doesn’t work. As far as I can tell, am following correctly with skin model selected. I don’t see an apply button or anything to actuate the choices.<br>
Thanks,<br>

<p>You can set the opacity for a model in two ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Double click the opacity (1.00) in the tree view. Then a slider appears moving which you cahange the opacity</li>
<li>Use opacity slider in the 3D Display section<br>
Neither needs an apply, just moving the slider.</li>
</ol>
