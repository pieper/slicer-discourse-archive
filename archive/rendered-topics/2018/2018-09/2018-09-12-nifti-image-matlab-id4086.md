<p>Good evening,<br>
I look for support because I am explained as the nifti images with matlab. What do the header fields mean? Which variable is the intensity of each pixel? I have the field nii, that contains .img, that contains .hdr. I need the intensity of each pixel relatively to each coordinate (x,y,z). How can i express this in an editor in Matlab?</p>
<p>Thanks for answers.</p>

<p>Here is a nice tutorial on NIFTI in Python:</p>
<p><a href="http://nipy.org/nibabel/nifti_images.html" class="onebox" target="_blank">http://nipy.org/nibabel/nifti_images.html</a></p>
<p>I would suggest to use Python if you are just getting started, and follow that tutorial. But presumably a Nifti library also exists for Matlab.</p>
