<p>Hi everyone,<br>
I´m currently working with the ShapeVariationAnalyser Extension in the 3D Slicer version 4.8.1.<br>
My aim is to create an average model out of seven vtk models, which have all the same amount of points.<br>
I was processing the data according to the description:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/Nightly/Modules/ShapeVariationAnalyzer" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/Nightly/Modules/ShapeVariationAnalyzer</a></p>
<p>However, after the computation of the mean group file, the right file for the “Morphological classifier” can´t be selected in the tab “CSV File mean”, so I can´t go on with further steps.</p>
<p>Did anyone of you had a similar problem and knows how to solve it? I would be very pleased for any kind of help!</p>
