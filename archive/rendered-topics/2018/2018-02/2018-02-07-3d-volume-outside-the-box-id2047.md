<p>Hey everyone,<br>
I have a problem with 3D slicer 4.8.<br>
The 3D volume is not located inside the coordination box. (It is seen somewhere outside the central box.) How can I relocate that inside the box?<br>
Thanks a lot.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>You should be able to update the box clicking on “CenterView Button” found in the 3D View controller on the right of the push pin.</p>
