<p>Dear wonderful Slicer community-</p>
<p>Can anyone give me some advise to speed my learning curve.  I have a 80 ADC maps from babies and want to manually create a new volume that contains my drawn annotation of viably abnormal voxels.</p>
<p>Step 1: Open the ADC volume in Slicer<br>
Step 2: ???</p>
<p>Many thanks!<br>
Randy</p>
<p>Operating system: MacBook Pro running Sierra<br>
Slicer version: 4.8.1<br>
Expected behavior: unsure what to expect but guess it will be awesome<br>
Actual behavior: TSTT- still downloading</p>

<p>Hey, welcome to the forum <a class="mention" href="/u/randygollub">@RandyGollub</a> !  (For those who don’t know her personally, Randy is a real neuroscience pro and a friend so I’ll also help her get started but advice from the forum is more than welcome).</p>
<p>To answer your question:<br>
Step 1. drag and drop file on slicer to load<br>
Step 2. open segment editor, add a segment and start drawing<br>
Step 3. save as a nii file</p>
<p>(There are for sure some non-obvious substeps but that’s the basic idea).</p>
<p>Maybe start by watching this video:<br>

<p>In terms of tutorials, Sonia’s “General Introduction” slides should be good for reference:<br>

<p>Also you’ll want to look through the Segment Editor documentation:<br>
