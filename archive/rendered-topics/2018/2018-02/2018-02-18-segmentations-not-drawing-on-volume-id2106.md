<p>At random, when i try to edit a newly created segmentation with the paint or draw effect, the segmentation map does not update at all. The error log shows:</p>
<p>Input port 0 of algorithm vtkImageMapToWindowLevelColors(000002564BEED4C0) has 0 connections but is not optional.</p>
<p>I usually have to restart slicer and then it works!</p>
