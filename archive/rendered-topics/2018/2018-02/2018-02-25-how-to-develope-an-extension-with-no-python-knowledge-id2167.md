<p><a class="mention" href="/u/borisbritva">@BorisBritva</a> Thanks for sharing the link, pointing user into useful resources makes sense. As a side note, the website seems unresponsive.</p>
<p>Would it be possible to update your post with a summary of what the website is about and giving more context ?</p>
