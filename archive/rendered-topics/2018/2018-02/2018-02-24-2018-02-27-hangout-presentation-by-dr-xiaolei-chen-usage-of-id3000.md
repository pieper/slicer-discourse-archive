<p>Hi Slicers -</p>
<p>Next Tuesday 9:30-11 EST we’ll have a special guest presentation and discussion from Dr. Xiaolei Chen, a neurosurgeon from Beijing and a leader in 3D Slicer use in China.  Topics include the Chinese Slicer community, novel neurosurgical applications, and advanced visualization techniques.</p>
<p>We will use the regular Slicer hangout link:  <a href="https://bit.ly/slicer-googlemeet-hosted-by-kitware">https://bit.ly/slicer-googlemeet-hosted-by-kitware</a></p>
<p>Note that this is a google service so it may not be easily reachable from China.  Part of the discussion will be about how best to facilitate international communications.</p>
<p>If you are interested in attending, please answer this quick poll to help us plan:</p>

<p>Thanks a lot,Professor Steve!<br>
Because of the super power of 3D Slicer,more and more Chinese users are interested in the software and exploring the clinic applications. We will pay attention to the presentation closely and watch the live-stream if possible.<br>
Best wishes!<br>
Dr.Xie</p>

<p><a class="mention" href="/u/pieper">@pieper</a> I think there is a good chance we’ll reach the limit of Google hangout participants. Could  you broadcast a YouTube live stream as well? It is quite straightforward to set it up using OBS.</p>

<p>Great idea <a class="mention" href="/u/lassoan">@lassoan</a>, I have never set that up or used OBS - would you be able to do it?</p>

<p><a class="mention" href="/u/arankin">@arankin</a> has set it up on my computer once and it did not seem complicated and there are many tutorials about how to do it. OBS has to run on the presenter’s computer, so I’m not sure if I can help much.</p>

## Post #6 by @pieper (2018-02-24 15:16 UTC)

<p>I won’t be with Dr. Chen and I wouldn’t want to ask him to set it up himself.  Couldn’t anyone who is in the meeting just broadcast their browser window?</p>

<p>A hangout can be rebroadcast directly with Youtube Live<br>
<a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/7083786" class="onebox" target="_blank">https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/7083786</a><br>
and<br>
<a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2853700">https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2853700</a> (click “Events”)</p>
<p>edit: I just tried and it seems to work well – watched on second computer too. Just be sure to select “Public” for event type when creating the Hangout. I tried “Unlisted” first, and the video was not available unless I logged in to google.</p>

<p>We usually use the Google Meet so we can have 25 participants but I don’t know if that also works with the youtube live, so maybe we should use a hangout for this one.  I will be traveling and on uncertain wifi so it would be great if someone can set this up.</p>

## Post #9 by @lassoan (2018-02-24 16:56 UTC)

<p>OK. If there will be more than 25 participants I’ll broadcast the hangout from my screen.</p>

---

## Post #10 by @jcfr (2018-02-24 19:02 UTC)

<p>Would it help if we do a “hangout” instead of a “meet” event ?  We can also easily do this.</p>

---

## Post #11 by @lassoan (2018-02-26 00:02 UTC)

<p>Based on the number of votes above, we may not need broadcasting. We can try hangout broadcasting sometime, just to see how well it works.</p>

<p>Thank you. Dear Steven Pieper. What’s the website to watch the livestream?</p>

<p>Reminder: we’ll use the google meet link here for Dr. Chen’s talk:</p>

<p>Thanks a lot Professor. Nice theory and great concept. I watched it. Your work is hats off.</p>

<p>why uncertain wifi? you can use portable wifi which will be available wherever you travel along with you.</p>
