<p>Since 2013, we have been giving credit to our fellow co-authors when integrating changes in our code bases. This was done by using commit message trailers like this one:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">Co-authored-by: FirstName LastName &lt;email@domain.org&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Here are the earliest occurrences of such acknowledgment: <a href="https://github.com/commontk/CTK/commit/9aa389d2bfbd816b41229b517451912d891bc968">commontk/CTK@9aa389d</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Slicer/Slicer/commit/43808ca41265af260aae0b018032f0703392f834">Slicer/Slicer@43808ca</a>.</p>
<p>What is great is that GitHub now support this too. It will be part of your contribution statistics:</p>

  <p>With faster onboarding for junior developers, increased code quality, and more thorough code review, it’s easy to see why more developers than ever are writing code collaboratively. Your team’s (and our own) great results from social coding motivated...</p>

  </p>

  </article>

  <div class="onebox-metadata">

  <div style="clear: both"></div>
</aside>

<p>Additionally, we often use trailer like this one:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">Thanks: FirstName LastName &lt;email@domain.org&gt;
Reviewed-by: FirstName LastName &lt;email@domain.org&gt;
Suggested-by: FirstName LastName &lt;email@domain.org&gt;
</code></pre>
