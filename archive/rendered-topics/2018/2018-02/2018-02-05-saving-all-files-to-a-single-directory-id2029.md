<p>I was wondering if there was a way we could get the feature added that allows a universal selection to the saving dialogue box? If you have multiple files, and don’t want to save it as an mrb file, it gets tedious selecting all of the directories individually. In addition, it would be nice to have a default choice for particular file types such as saving volumes only as nrrd files instead of having to select it individually.</p>

<p>The first can already be done in the dialog - did you see the button next to save to change directory for selected files?</p>
<p>The second can be done by setting up a script to run on startup - see:</p>
