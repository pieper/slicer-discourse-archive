<p>Operating system: Windows 7<br>
Slicer version: 4.8.1</p>
<p>I am not sure how to begin this project. I have an MRI of my brain and I would like to segment and label all of the important anatomical structures, creating an atlas.</p>
<p>I have the files in Nifti format and plan to label a post GRE T1 scan acquired in the coronal plane.</p>
<p>First, I want to link this coronal scan with a scan acquired in the sagittal plane, as the some structures are more easily seen sagittaly.</p>
<p>Next, I want to segment out the important structures and label them with text indicating the name of the structures.</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to save the updated file as a Nifti.</p>
<p>I would probably be doing this all manually, as I am only slightly familiar with Python.\</p>
<p>How would I go about doing these things?</p>
<p>Thank You.</p>

<p>That all sounds pretty doable - did you start by looking at the <a href="https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/4.8/Training">tutorials</a>?</p>
<p>Also, you probably know there are many brain atlases already available so you might want to do some background searching to see if you can use what’s already been done.</p>
