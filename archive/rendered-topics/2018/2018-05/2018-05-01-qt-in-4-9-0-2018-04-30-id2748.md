<p>I downloaded the above nightly build, but qt.QWebView() seems to be missing.  Is it part of the nightly?</p>

<p>With Qt5 there’s been a migration from QtWebKit to <a href="https://wiki.qt.io/QtWebEngine">QtWebEngine</a>.  There’s some debate as to whether this is a good thing, but for now we are aiming to make QtWebEngine work for us.  Within Slicer the slicer.qSlicerWebWidget() is planned as a usable replacement for the qt.QWebView() which seems to work okay on windows but has some issues elsewhere.</p>

<p>Thanks Steve!  I will give it a spin.  We would like to update SlicerPathology so that it will work with our newest QuIP system.  - Erich</p>

<p>Note that SlicerPathology has not been functional for quite some time. The underlying issue has been discussed on this forum: <a href="https://discourse.slicer.org/t/pathology-module-install-fail-due-to-slicewidget-attribute-error/2269" class="inline-onebox">Pathology module install fail due to sliceWidget attribute error</a>, and documented in this GitHub issue: <a href="https://github.com/SBU-BMI/SlicerPathology/issues/100" class="inline-onebox">Module won't start - testing code committed by accident? · Issue #100 · SBU-BMI/SlicerPathology · GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>More recently, build errors cropped in, most likely due to the recent upgrade of the Slicer dependency libraries - see dashboard <a href="http://slicer.cdash.org/index.php?project=SlicerPreview&amp;filtercount=1&amp;showfilters=1&amp;field1=buildname&amp;compare1=63&amp;value1=SlicerPathology">here</a>.</p>

<p>We’ll get it squared away.  - Erich</p>
