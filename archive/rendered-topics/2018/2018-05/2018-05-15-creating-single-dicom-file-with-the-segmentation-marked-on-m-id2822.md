<p>Operating system: Windows 10<br>
Slicer version: 4.8.1<br>
Expected behavior:<br>
Actual behavior:</p>
<p>I am working with an MRI dataset (3D Sag T1). I wish to segment (a single gyrus) an area using slicer and then change the corresponding voxels on the MRI DICOM images to create a new single DICOM file with the segmented area (a gyrus) appearing in high density/white (on T1 images).<br>
The eventual aim  is to create volume rendering which can run on a standard DICOM viewer (without use of slicer) with the segmented area visible separately (marked out) from the rest of the gyri.<br>
Thanks in advance!!</p>
