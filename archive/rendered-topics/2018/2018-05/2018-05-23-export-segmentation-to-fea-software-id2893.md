<p>Dear Andras,</p>
<p>Hello again and thanks for your previous instructions. I could do what I aimed to do.</p>
<p>Currently, I need a 3D model of the long bone so that I can import into a CAD and eventually into a FEA.<br>
In the Segment Editor module, after applying threshold, Island, etc, the long bone is selected with highlighting the slices (the actual cross sections of the bone). Afterwards, I hit the export/model in the Segmentations module and then I import the generated file into a CAD (such as CATIA). However, only the outer and inner surface of the long bone is shown in CAD(without the cross sections). In the 3D slicer, it seems that a 3D model is generated, maybe it is due to exporting as an STL file?</p>
<p>Any help you provide is highly appreciated.</p>
<p>Saeed</p>
