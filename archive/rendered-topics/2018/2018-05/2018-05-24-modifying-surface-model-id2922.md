<p>Operating system: Windows 10<br>
Slicer version: 4.8.1</p>
<p>I have a Model - it is a surface mesh (meaning it is just comprised of a surface).<br>
I would like to modify my model so that it is “solidified” (meaning it is no longer hollow but a solid model)<br>
How can I essentially fill the volume inside my surface model?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
