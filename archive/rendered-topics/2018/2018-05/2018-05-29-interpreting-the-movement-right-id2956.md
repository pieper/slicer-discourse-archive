<p>Dear Martin and Beatriz,</p>
<p>trying to understand the movement of the hippocampus in this clinical group (compared to control) thus statistical map and diff mesh vector above.<br>
My interpretation is that apart from atrophy is the hippocampus more straight in the clinical group</p>
<p>Do you agree with this interpretation?   Best Olof</p>

<p>Hi Olof. I would interpret these visualized changes as a largely general atrophy that takes place all over the hippocampus, a bit more pronounced on lateral body and in the head. Basically all of CA1 seems to be significantly affected, possibly also parts of CA2, but CA3 seems less so. Martin</p>

<p>I agree with Martin. Is there a possibility of neighboring structures also pushing the hippocampi a bit?</p>

<p>OK, great! Yes I agree with Beatriz it is most likely so that HC is moved  … although I think that the neurodegenerative process is causing this rahter by the absence of neighboring structures … rather than by the presence of another structure.</p>
