<p>Hi people,<br>
In short, I’d like to write a batch code to calculate Diffusion Tensors and FA for multiple DTI .nii data.<br>
I want to replicate steps in this tutorial <a href="https://www.slicer.org/w/images/3/35/DiffusionMRITutorial_UCSF2010_SoniaPujol.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener">DTI-tutorial</a> automatically. I will also need to convert all of my files(with associated bval and bvec) to nrrd files. I know how to do the steps using GUI, but couldn’t find a clue on how to pass those paramteres in a batch python code.<br>
Any Help?</p>
