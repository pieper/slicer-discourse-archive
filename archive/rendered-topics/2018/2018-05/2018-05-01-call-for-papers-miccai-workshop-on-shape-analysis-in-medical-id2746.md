<p><strong>MICCAI SHAPEMI</strong><br>
<strong>Workshop on Shape Analysis in Medical Imaging</strong><br>
<strong>Granada, Spain, Sep 20th, 2018</strong><br>
<strong><a href="https://shapemi.github.io/">https://shapemi.github.io/</a></strong></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>(*) Description</strong></p>
<p>We gladly announce the workshop for <strong>Shape Analysis in Medical Imaging</strong> (SHAPEMI, <a href="https://shapemi.github.io/">https://shapemi.github.io/</a>) held in conjunction with the conference on MICCAI – Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Interventions, in Granada, Spain, Sep 20th, 2018.</p>
<p><strong>(*) Aim and Scope</strong></p>
<p><strong>Shape and geometry</strong> processing methods are receiving increased attention, notably, in medical imaging.</p>
<p>This workshop provide a presentation venue for researchers working in shape and geometrical analysis, such as <strong>shape modeling, geometric learning and statistics</strong>. This year’s edition also brings a focus on applications.</p>
<p>Original contributions as well as well as exciting applications in medical imaging are sought in the form of:</p>
<ul>
<li>8-12 page papers</li>
<li>2-3 page abstracts</li>
</ul>
<p>Every accepted paper or abstract can include a live demo.</p>
<p><strong>(*) Targets topics</strong> include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shape Processing and Analysis</li>
<li>Shape Learning and Classification</li>
<li>Geometric Learning and Manifold-based Methods</li>
<li>Statistics of Shapes and Deformations</li>
<li>Spectral Shape Analysis</li>
<li>Spectral Clustering and Dimensionality Reduction</li>
<li>Shape Modeling and Representation</li>
<li>Shape Segmentation, Registration and Correspondence</li>
<li>Longitudinal Shape Analysis and Processing</li>
<li>Medical Applications focused on Shape Analysis</li>
<li>Evaluation / quality assessment of shape models</li>
<li>Relevant demos of freely available shape analysis software</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>(*) Keynote</strong> speakers on the preliminary list include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dr. Michael Bronstein, University of Lugano</li>
<li>Dr. Daniel Rueckert, Imperial College London</li>
<li>Dr. Stanley Durrleman, Inria/ICM Aramis Lab</li>
<li>More to be announced</li>
</ul>
<p>This workshop will provide an invaluable opportunity for researchers to present recent work on shape analysis in medical imaging. <strong>Interactions</strong> among fellow researchers will foster a deeper understanding of the underlying concepts and will provide insights on <strong>medical imaging applications</strong>.</p>
<p>Best Paper Award Sponsored by <a href="https://www.kitware.com/">Kitware</a>.</p>
<p>** <strong>IMPORTANT DATES</strong> **</p>
<ul>
<li>Deadline for paper submission: ** <strong>June 25th, 2018, 23:59 PST</strong> **</li>
<li>Notification of Acceptance: July 25th, 2018</li>
<li>MICCAI Early bird registration:  August 10th, 2018</li>
