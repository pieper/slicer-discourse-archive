<p>The KiwiViewer 2.0 was the best App( iphone) for me to open a vtk file caculated from 3d slicer. But the KiwiViewer have stoped the developing of the software. After a seaching in the internet, the old-one KiwiViewer 1.0 was found, and there is no fuctuion for transparent which is very important for me to see the internal model…<br>
So does anyone have an experience to view many models in Android platform.<br>
Thanks!<br>

<p>There are many 3D model viewers for Android (for example <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.transformandlighting.emb3d">Emb3D</a> is quite nice) which can open .obj files that can contain large number of objects. I did not search a lot, but couldn’t find one that can easily show/hide individual objects in the model (of a specific material in an .obj file).</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://discourse.slicer.org/t/connecting-htc-vive-with-3d-slicer/1299/17?u=lassoan">view the Slicer scene on Android phone in virtual reality</a>, but it requires a running desktop computer and currently you cannot interact with the models just view them.</p>
<p>There could be web-browser-based solutions as well. There are several websites that allows you to view 3D models on your phone, see for example <a href="https://sketchfab.com/">https://sketchfab.com/</a>.</p>

<p>Hi <a class="mention" href="/u/timeanddoctor">@timeanddoctor</a> and anyone else interested in mobile viewer,</p>
<p>Updating Kiwiviewer is definitively on the radar but we (at Kitware) don’t have a timeline to share.<br>
Also additional funding would definitively help catalyze the effort.</p>
<p>Do not hesitate to reach out,<br>
