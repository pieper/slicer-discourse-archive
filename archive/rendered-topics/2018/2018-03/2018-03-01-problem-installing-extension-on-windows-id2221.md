<p>Operating system: Windows<br>
Slicer version:4.1.1<br>
Expected behavior: download occurs<br>
Actual behavior:<br>
Error GUI pops up, informing me that " error opening files for writing"<br>
C:\programfiles\slicer 4.8.1\slicer.exe</p>
<p>If I ‘ignore’ this, the next file in sequence also has an opening error.<br>
Any advice please?<br>
Steve</p>

<p>Hi <a class="mention" href="/u/stephen_gwilym">@Stephen_Gwilym</a></p>
<p>Thanks for the feedback.</p>
<p>Could you provide the exact step leading to this problem ?</p>
<p>Also, the you indicated you are using Slicer <code>4.1.1</code> but the installation path seems to indicate <code>4.8.1</code>. Which version are you effectively using ?</p>

<p>Make sure you have write access and enough space in you <code>Extensions installation</code> folder. You can find its location in menu: Edit / Application settings / Extensions -&gt; Extensions installation path.</p>
