<p>Operating system: Windows 10<br>
Slicer version: 4.8.0<br>
Expected behavior: Correctly loading the DICOM-RT from ePAD<br>
Actual behavior:</p>
<p>I have some DICOM and DICOM-RT files generated from Stanford ePAD system (<a href="https://epad.stanford.edu/" rel="nofollow noopener">https://epad.stanford.edu/</a>). But when I was trying to load these files into Slicer, the DICOM-RT shows inconsistency alignment with its corresponding DICOM files.</p>
<p>The problem may be the inconsistency “Patient Position” in the DICOM files.</p>
<p>Are these any extensions to correctly load the DICOM-RT generated by Stanford ePAD software? Thanks.</p>

<p>SlicerRT extension loads images and RT structure sets from valid DICOM files in their correct position (tested on lots of data sets; there are no known issues). If there is misalignment then most likely the DICOM files are invalid or contain incorrect information.</p>

<p>Hi <a class="mention" href="/u/lassoan">@lassoan</a>, thanks a lot for your kind reply!</p>
<p>Yeah, the SlicerRT is great for loading DICOM and the corresponding DICOM-RT.  The possible reason may the ePAD has another convention when generating the DICOM-RT files.</p>
