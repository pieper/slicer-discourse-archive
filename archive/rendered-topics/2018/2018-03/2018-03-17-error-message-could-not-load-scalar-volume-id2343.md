<p>Hi Forum,</p>
<p>I´m trying to load a DICOM file from CT Abdominal, but always get the error message: could not load… scalar volume, any hints?, the link to the archive is this:</p>
<p>[link removed due to potentially containing patient identifiable information]</p>
<p>Any help would be really appreciated,</p>
<p>Linda</p>

<p>The data set only contains screenshots of 3D renderings. These are unusable for any kind of processing or visualization. You need the original CT volume.</p>
