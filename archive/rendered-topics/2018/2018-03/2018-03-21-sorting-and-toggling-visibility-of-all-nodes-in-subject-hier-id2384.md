<p>What nodes are not listed that you would like to show/hide?</p>

<p>They are all listed but for segmentation nodes for example, there is a ‘visible’ icon that looks like an eye. I would like to be able to click that for the entire group for example, instead of individually toggling visible for say 10 segmentation nodes in my scene.</p>

<p>You can create a new folder and drag-and-drop all your nodes that belong together (you can select multiple nodes by using Ctrl or Shift + Left-Click). If you click the eye icon of the folder then it shows/hides all nodes in the folder at once.</p>
