<p>Hi!</p>
<p>I have been doing segmentation for EAT and Ventricles. I use manual segmentation by hand. Whenever I look at the 3D Model generated by 3D Slicer, I see that there are gaps between slices even if I segmented every slice… I need to generate 3D Volumes based on my segmentation.</p>
<p>I also figured that whenever I drag my .nrrd and .seg.nrrd files into 3D Slicer, my segmentation seems less than what I make. If the segmentation is thin, 3d Slicer assumes that there is nothing there,I am guessing. Is there anything I can do about it? I would appreciate if any of you help me.</p>
<p>You can find the pictures at the atachment,</p>
<p>Your help is highly appreciated in this matter.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>This is a common issue when the input volume is  highly anisotropic. I would recommend to always use Crop volume module to resample the input volume to an isotropic voxel size before starting segmentation.</p>
<p>You can of course also turn off smoothing during model generation (in Segment editor module, click the small arrow on the <code>Show 3D</code> button and set surface smoothing to 0), but then the reconstructed surface would have staircase artifacts.</p>
