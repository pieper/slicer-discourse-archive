<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I am trying to use the Denoising feature of DTIPrep, which uses a Rician LMMSE Filter from 3DSlicer. However, I cannot find the path for this tool, and I can’t seem to find the answer online on this forum or on the documentation (<a href="https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/4.6/Modules/DWIRicianLMMSEFilter" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/4.6/Modules/DWIRicianLMMSEFilter</a>). <a href="https://discourse.slicer.org/t/stationary-rician-noise-removal-in-dwi/1989">This</a> relevant forum post also remains unanswered. I am using Slicer 4.6.2.</p>
<p>I would appreciate any guidance!</p>
<p>Thank you in advance!</p>
