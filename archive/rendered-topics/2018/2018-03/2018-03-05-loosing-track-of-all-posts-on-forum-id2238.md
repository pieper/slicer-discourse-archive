<p>Turn off “mailing list mode” and/or change the other notification preferences.</p>
<p>(by the way, all the messages should be from <code>slicer@discoursemail.com</code>, so you could filter them, e.g. to a specific folder if you use gmail or most desktop mail clients)</p>

<p>The beauty of discourse forums is that you can configure them to only send you information that is relevant for you, in a way and at a rate that you are comfortable to process.</p>
<p>You can customize which categories you are notified about at one place, here: <a href="https://discourse.slicer.org/u/lassoan/preferences/categories">https://discourse.slicer.org/u/lassoan/preferences/categories</a></p>
<p>I would suggest to only keep <code>Announcements</code>.</p>
<p>If you are only interested in a particular topic, then you can enable notification for those posts by specifying corresponding tag here: <a href="https://discourse.slicer.org/u/lassoan/preferences/tags">https://discourse.slicer.org/u/lassoan/preferences/tags</a></p>
<p>You can also keep a weekly or bi-weekly summary email to have a chance to glance through the activity on the forum (<a href="https://discourse.slicer.org/u/lassoan/preferences/emails">https://discourse.slicer.org/u/lassoan/preferences/emails</a>).</p>

<p>I think you need to also remove <code>Support</code> from the <code>Categories-&gt;Watching</code> and <code>Development</code> from <code>Categories-&gt;Watching first post</code> section of the preferences. Then you should only get emails for threads where you replied.</p>
<p>(I would suggest to keep “Announcements” in “Watching first post”, as that one is very low-traffic, just important notices that most people wouldn’t want to miss)</p>
