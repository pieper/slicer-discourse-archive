<p>Operating system: Windows 10<br>
Slicer version: 4.8.0</p>
<p>I’m trying to make a bone model from MRI data using slicer. The idea is to colour each slice and then slicer constructs a 3d model. I’m quite new to the program. I’ve bought a trackpad and am coloring in the parts which I think are bone in the image but the resolution is not very high so I’ve not been able to come up with a more efficient method.</p>
<p>Kind regards</p>

<p>In general, bone is not very well visible in MRI. If you have the option, use CT images instead.</p>
<p>You can find step-by-step segmentation tutorials here: <a href="https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/Nightly/Training#Slicer4_Image_Segmentation">https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/Nightly/Training#Slicer4_Image_Segmentation</a></p>

<p>Have you managed to find a solution to this? I am interested automating the segmentation of bone with MRI.</p>
