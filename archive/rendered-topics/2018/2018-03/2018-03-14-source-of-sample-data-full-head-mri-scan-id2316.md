<p>I would like to refer to the sample data “Full head MRI scan”. I wonder is the source information of this data available? Is it from a subject or averaged from several subjects and any information of the subject or the scan settings?</p>

<p>There is no such sample data as “Full head MRI scan”. Do you mean “MRHead”? You can find information about that data set here:</p>
