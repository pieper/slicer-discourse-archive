<p>Hi,</p>
<p>When using Slicer 4.9.0 2018-01-22 version, SlicerIGT cannot be found in the Extensions Manager.  I get this message:</p>
<p>No extensions found for win:64-bit, revision: ‘26853’. Please try a different combination</p>
<p>However, when I install Slicer version 4.8.1, SlicerIGT can be found.  Any reason for this?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>I’ve installed tonight’s nightly build (2018-03-09) but still cannot find the SlicerIGT extension.  Also fyi, when I type in text in the search bar in the Extensions Manager, sometimes the characters disappear and I have to re-type.</p>
<p>Thanks for your help.</p>

<p>Slicer nightly (preview) build version is going through major changes in these months, so sometimes certain extensions may fail to build for a few days. Either use latest stable version, or <a href="https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/Nightly/FAQ/General#Where_can_I_download_older_release_of_Slicer_.3F">download Slicer from a few days before</a>, or wait a few days for the extension to become available again.</p>
