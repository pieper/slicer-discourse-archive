<p>Problem report for Slicer 4.8.0 win-amd64: [please describe expected and actual behavior]</p>
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I’m registering two identical sets of images using the Genera Registration function and doing a rigid transformation. I’m surprised to see that there is non-zero translation and rotation transform being generated by the software. Since the two sets are identical, I don’t expect to see any transformation.</p>
<p>Can you comment if this is a bug?</p>
<p>Timothy</p>

<p>Non-linear optimizers used in registration methods usually explore the parameter space around the initial value and may stuck in a local optimum.</p>
<p>This is an inherent limitation of registration methods, but also an indication that your choice of optimization parameters or similarity metric could be improved.</p>
