<p>I’ve seen this error twice, yesterday and today, when I started filling in a form on Mantis (either a new issue or a response), and waited too long to submit. It happened again just now, after maybe 30 min. Reloading the page allows me to re-enter/copy the content and proceed, but this limitation seems quite unfriendly to bug reporters, who are (ideally!) collecting and confirming information over a period of time while filling in, before actually submitting.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>APPLICATION ERROR <span class="hashtag-raw">#2800</span> Invalid form security token.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Google takes me <a href="http://www.mantisbt.org/docs/master/en-US/Admin_Guide/html/admin.troubleshooting.html">here</a> which says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, this problem cannot be fixed without a major rework of the way sessions and form security are handled in MantisBT.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hmm.</p>

<p>I get this fairly often too, but fortunately if I just hit ‘back’ in the browser my note contents are still there and I can just click submit and everything is fine.</p>

<p>You are lucky. I get this error often, too, but for me the content is usually (maybe always) lost. If cannot be fixed then at least showing a warning could help (“submission has to be completed within X minutes, otherwise entered in text may be lost”).</p>

<p>Idem.</p>
<p>Before submitting form, I always copy the content in a buffer. I usually do this for any online form …</p>

<p>I am getting the same error while trying to sign up to report a bug. It doesn’t seem to help to click “Back” and try again after trying it numerous times. Is there a way an account can be created for me?</p>

<p>Hi <a class="mention" href="/u/cory.quammen">@cory.quammen</a>,</p>
<p>It turns out you already have an account. It was created in 2010 and the associated username is <code>cquammen</code></p>
<p>You should have received a password reset link.</p>
<p>(Ps: The Mantis message couldn’t definitively be improved and be more informative.)</p>
<p>Let us know if you have any other problem,<br>
Jc</p>

<p>Ah, thanks for resetting my password. I should have checked first <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=5" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> Looks like I am all set.</p>
