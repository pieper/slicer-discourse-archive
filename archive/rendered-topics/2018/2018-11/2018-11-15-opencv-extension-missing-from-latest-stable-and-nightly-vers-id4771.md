<p>Operating system: windows 10<br>
Slicer version: 4.10.0 (stable)</p>
<p>The slicer openCV extension appears to be missing from the latest stable (4.10.0, downloaded on 15/11/2018) and any of recent the nightly builds (tried versions from 13/11/2018, 14/11/2018, and 15/11/2018). Any reason behind this?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Rebecca Hisey</p>

<p>I’ve submitted a pull request with the fix: <a href="https://github.com/Slicer/SlicerOpenCV/pull/56">https://github.com/Slicer/SlicerOpenCV/pull/56</a></p>
<p>Once the fix is merged, SlicerOpenCV extension will be available for both preview and stable versions.</p>
