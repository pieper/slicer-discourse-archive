<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>So I have been trying to extract the vessels from a partial MRA brain scan. I wanted to try using the centerline model I got from the VMTK extension and a manual segmentation I did to isolate the vessels. Using the vesselness filtering in VMTK I manages to identify the max and min voxel sizes of the vessels. However I’m guessing I would need to make a script for this, but as I am not that familiar with python, I was wondering if anybody had any ideas or suggestions as to how to go about this?</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>Kyprianos</p>
