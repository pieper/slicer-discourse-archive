<p>Hi<br>
I want to change color/ brightness on selected area of my DICOM module. Not the full module but only selected area. For an example if I have a full body voume i want to change color or brigtness only head.</p>

<p>You can install <em>SegmentEditorExtraEffects</em> extension, which will add <em>Mask volume</em> effect to <em>Segment editor</em> module. This effect can be used to set any value in a region inside or outside a selected segment.</p>
<p>If this is not that you would need then please tell us a bit more about the clinical problem that you would like to solve. The operation that you described does not sound like something that is commonly performed on medical images, so maybe there are better ways to address the clinical need.</p>
