<p>Data probe seems to have an issue automatically resizing itself to fit its contents.The issue seems to be the default behavior after installing Slicer. I think this has been going on for a few weeks now, I tested today with the nightly (Windows) and recorded a video:<br>

<p>This can be very annoying, but it goes away sometimes after resizing the whole window, or undocking/redocking the module panel from the main window.</p>
<p>By the way, I wanted to register an account on Mantis to report this, but it doesn’t allow me to create a new account. It says invalid security token any time I try to submit the new account registration form. I tried in two different browsers.</p>

<p>Hi <a class="mention" href="/u/ungi">@ungi</a> -  Regarding mantis I just created a dummy account and it worked fine.  Can you try again?</p>
