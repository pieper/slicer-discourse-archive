<p>Hello:</p>
<p>Our project is self funded, we have been making slow progress along the years.</p>
<p>The immediate objective is to extract a 3D model of a cranium, as accurate as possible, based on the 2 X-rays taken during an autopsy at Bethesda Naval Hospital the night of November 22, 1963.</p>
