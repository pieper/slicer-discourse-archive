<p>Hello community, this is Mike. A newcomer to the community,.</p>
<p>I want to use slicer to process some ultradound files for 3d printing. I have not been able to gather info of the ultrasound volumes.</p>
<p>How can I export those files from my machine?</p>
<p>Best.</p>

<p>You can read certain GE 3D ultrasound files into 3D Slicer using SlicerHeart extension. See more details in the <a href="https://github.com/SlicerHeart/SlicerHeart" rel="nofollow noopener">SlicerHeart extension documentation</a>. Let us know if you have any questions (or if it all works well).</p>

<p>Usually you would write to a CD or USB stick directly from the ultrasound console; or push images to a DICOM PACS or workstation and write out the images from there.</p>
