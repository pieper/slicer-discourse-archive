<p>Can anyone give a step by step guide to use 4.10.0 to convert DICOM to STL for model fabrication. The step that seems to be different from the you tube videos available is the Editor. In the 4.10.0 version, their is only a segmentation editor, no “editor” in the drop down module window. Would appreciate any guidance to convert DICOM to STL</p>
