<p>Operating system: Windows 7<br>
Slicer version: 4.11.0<br>
Expected behavior: To download<br>
Actual behavior: 100% loads on the download bar and two pop ups saying extensions downloading pop up but then the screen freezes and the program becomes non-responsive and crashes.</p>

<p>Is this repeatable?  What happens if you try again?</p>
<p>Please post the log file from a failed install (look in the Help -&gt; Report a bug dialog for logs of past runs).</p>

<p>Maybe you are behind a hospital or company firewall that blocks the Extension Manager. Try to manually download and install the extension using your web browser, as described <a href="https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/Nightly/SlicerApplication/ExtensionsManager#How_to_manually_download_an_extension_package.3F" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a>.</p>
