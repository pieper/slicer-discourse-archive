<p>I’ve seen this in several extension builds over the past two nights, causing build (or upload?) failure:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">Operation too slow.  Less than 1 bytes/sec transferred the last 120 seconds
</code></pre>

<p>Thanks for the note.</p>
<p>Waiting we finalize the transition to a new system to manage extension, I will ask our sysadmin to setup daily restart of the server at noon.</p>
