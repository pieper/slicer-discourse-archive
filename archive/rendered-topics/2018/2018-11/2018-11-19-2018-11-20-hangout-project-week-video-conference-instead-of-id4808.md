<p>Tomorrow <span class="mention">@10am</span> Boston time will be our next preparation videoconference for Project Week#30</p>
<p>Zoom will be used to hold the videoconference: <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fzoom.us%2Fj%2F112427205&amp;sa=D&amp;usd=2&amp;usg=AFQjCNGzSLBxZN5zcYqiBCCQCtKjXlybwg">https://zoom.us/j/112427205</a> (This and call-in information have been added to the public google calendar “namic-project-week”).</p>
<p>The event will be held January 28-Feb 1, 2019 in Las Palmas, Gran Canaria.  Please look here for details about the event: <a href="https://na-mic.github.io/ProjectWeek/PW30_2019_GranCanaria/">https://na-mic.github.io/ProjectWeek/PW30_2019_GranCanaria/</a></p>
<p>Background: The Project Week is a week-long hackathon of hands on activity in which medical image computing researchers create solutions using the open source image computing platform <a href="http://www.slicer.org/">3D Slicer</a>, and <a href="http://www.vtk.org/">VTK</a>, <a href="http://www.itk.org/">ITK</a>, <a href="http://www.cmake.org/">CMake</a>, and <a href="http://www.cdash.org/">CDash</a> libraries. Participants work collaboratively on solutions that lie on the interfaces of the fields of computer science, mechanical engineering, biomedical engineering, and medicine. In contrast to conferences and workshops where the primary focus is to report results, the objective of the Project Week is to provide a venue for creators of medical image computing open-source software creators to collaboratively work.
