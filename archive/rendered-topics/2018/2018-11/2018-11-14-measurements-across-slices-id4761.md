<p>slicer newbie. How do I measure distances across slices on skull ct’s. Once the measurement is done how do I erase the fiducials or ruler landmarks for another measurement?<br>

<p>You can either place annotation rulers; or place markup fiducial points and see distance by right-clicking in the point list in Markups module.</p>
<p>Probably the simplest way to delete annotations and markups is to go to Data module, right-click on what you want to remove, and choose Delete.</p>
