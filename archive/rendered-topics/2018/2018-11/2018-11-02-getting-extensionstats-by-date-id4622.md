<p>Hi,<br>
Is it possible to use ExtensionStats and get statistics by download date rather than release version?<br>

<p>Download counts are aggregated for each downloadable item. I don’t think individual download dates are stored. Extension download stats is a scripted module, so you can add some logs to see what exactly is in the records that are downloaded from the server.</p>
