<p>Hi Andras et al,</p>
<p>I truly enjoy the elastix module. Given that have a large amount of data that I would like process, I am looking for easiest way to do this via a command line. Is there anything available that is close to BRAINSfit (via CLI)?</p>
<p>Thanks<br>
ALex</p>

<p>If you need to process many datasets, you will probably be better of running Elastix directly, unless you need some sort of interaction with Slicer as a preprocessing step.<br>
