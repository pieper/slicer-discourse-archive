<p>Hi,<br>
For the segment comparison, the Hausdorff distance gives the Maximum, Average and 95%. This is from Plastimatch.<br>
Is this the boundary Hausdorff?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>The distances returned in the table are boundary Hausdorff.</p>

<p>Thank you for your quick reply. I am presuming they are undirected?</p>

<p>Yes, it is the undirected distance.</p>
