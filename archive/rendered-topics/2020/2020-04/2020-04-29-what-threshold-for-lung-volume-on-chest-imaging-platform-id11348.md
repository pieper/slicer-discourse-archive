<p>Hello to everybody!<br>
What are the % (LAA%950, LAA925%, LAA910%, etcc…) on Parenchimal analysis to obtein 100% (i.e. lung volume 5.500 L)? If I calculate the well-areated lung (-950 to -700)  with Segmentation editor and statistics, what is the threshold to obtein the whole lung volume in mm3 including lesions like consolidation? THANKS!</p>
