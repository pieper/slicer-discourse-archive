<p>Dr. Joost,</p>
<p>I am writing an article for publication in a biomedical engineering congress in Brazil, and I intend to quote and reference part (a) of figure 1 of the article: Computational Radiomics System to Decode the Radiographic Phenotype.<br>
Is there a website where I need to request authorization from the authors?</p>
<p>Thank you very much.<br>

<p>If you want to re-use part of the figure in your own work, you need to contact Cancer Research. You can tell them the authors agree, of course providing the proper reference is added.</p>
