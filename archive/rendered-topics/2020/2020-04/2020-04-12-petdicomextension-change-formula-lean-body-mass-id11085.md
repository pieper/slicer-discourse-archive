<p>Hi!<br>
I would to calculate the SUV corrected to the lean body mass, using a different formula from that used by the author of the extension.<br>
I downloaded the extension for Github, and edited the respective file (a .cxx file), but now I don’t know what I have to do in order to import that extension to Slicer.<br>
I thought the procedure was simple but I afraid I it necessary compilation or some think like that. I tried it in VS even I don’t C++ and think king of languages and I cannot to performed it.</p>
