<p>Sorry as usual I can’t make the meeting.</p>
<p>However, I do have one comment about the transition. Is the document <a href="https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/Nightly/Developers/Tutorials/MigrationGuide/Slicer#Slicer_backward_incompatible_changes" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a> expected to serve a list of all major changes? If so I am seeing nothing about the recent coordinate system change for exported models and fiducials.</p>
<p>For me that’s a major change, already impacting our workflow. Perhaps a more comprehensive transition guide is necessary, one not just focused on the developer’s point-of-view, but for user functionality as well…</p>

<p>Good point. Probably we missed this from the migration guide because it <em>should</em> not be a backward incompatible change, only in very special cases (since coordinate system information has been recorded in files for several years now). But since there is a chance it may impact some people, I added a section now: <a href="https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/Nightly/Developers/Tutorials/MigrationGuide/Slicer#Models_are_saved_in_LPS_coordinate_system_by_default" class="inline-onebox">Documentation/Nightly/Developers/Tutorials/MigrationGuide/Slicer - Slicer Wiki</a></p>

    Hi all: 
During the most recent developer hangout (<a href="https://discourse.slicer.org/t/2020-04-21-hangout/11208" class="inline-onebox">2020.04.21 Hangout</a>), we discussed possible feature highlights for the Slicer 5 release notes.  Usually, the release notes document is generated immediately before the release.  This time, we would like to start the process a little earlier.  A Google doc for collecting items that developers would like to have featured in the highlights section of the release notes is linked below: 


Feel free to add to this document, or suggest things to be add…
