<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I added an image I found on the Slicer Registration FAQ to the <a href="https://torchio.readthedocs.io/transforms/augmentation.html#randomelasticdeformation" rel="nofollow noopener">TorchIO docs</a>, citing the source. Is that ok? Let me you know if I should add any info or if you’d like me to remove it.</p>

<p>You are free to use the images for any purpose, but of course we always appreciate any references or acknowledgments.</p>

<p>This is what I have at the moment, by <em>citing the source</em> I meant that I explicitly said where the image comes from and added the link.</p>

<p>I tried to mark your answer as the solution, but I couldn’t. Is that only available for the “Support” category?</p>

<p>Yes, that’s only available there.</p>
