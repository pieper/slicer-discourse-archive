<p>Hi all:</p>
<p>During the most recent developer hangout (<a href="https://discourse.slicer.org/t/2020-04-21-hangout/11208" class="inline-onebox">2020.04.21 Hangout</a>), we discussed possible feature highlights for the Slicer 5 release notes.  Usually, the release notes document is generated immediately before the release.  This time, we would like to start the process a little earlier.  A Google doc for collecting items that developers would like to have featured in the highlights section of the release notes is linked below:</p>

<p>Summary: The purpose of this document is to help us collect highlights / features for Slicer 5 as we move closer to the release date.  This will help us write up the final release notes, making sure that everyone has a chance to highlight...</p>

<p>We have added “feature” tag on all posts announcing new features, so we should have a complete list of features (along with description and pictures &amp; videos): <a href="https://discourse.slicer.org/tag/feature">https://discourse.slicer.org/tag/feature</a></p>
