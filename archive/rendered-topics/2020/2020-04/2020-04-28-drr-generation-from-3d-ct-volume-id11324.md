<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I am looking for a method producing digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRR) from CT volumes and then exporting the DRR as a DICOM file. I have seen basic python scripts that do a similar type of thing and have had no success with the plastimatch module.</p>
<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated!</p>
<p>Thanks in advance</p>
