<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>I have processed my DTI and am interested in getting statistics on certain areas I made labels for. Right now I am creating each map using the “Diffusion Tensor Scalar Maps” module, and then using the Label statistics to get the info needed one by one. I’m wondering if there’s a way to do the this in bulk? i.e., create all the scalar measurement maps for a subject - and run statistics on all of the scalar measurement maps?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Hi <a class="mention" href="/u/learningsliceryay">@LearningSlicerYay</a> - The short answer of course is to write some small python script for that.  <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/smile.png?v=9" title=":smile:" class="emoji" alt=":smile:"></p>

<p>Thanks for the reply Steve. Wish that was part of my skill set but guess I just need to work with it what I’ve got for now!</p>
