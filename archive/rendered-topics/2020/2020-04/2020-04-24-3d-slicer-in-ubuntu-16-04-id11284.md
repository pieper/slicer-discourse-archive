<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I’m trying to run 3D Slicer in ubuntu 16.04.</p>
<p>I’ve downloaded the Linux version of slicer, opened the tar.gz file and copied over the containing folder to a different location.</p>
<p>I’m trying to run the command ./Slicer but it brings up an error saying:</p>
<p>“bash: ./Slicer: cannot execute binany file: Exec format error”</p>

<p>Did you made the Slicer file executable ?</p>
<p>Also is the the correct bit ? 32/64</p>

<p>Hi Manjula,</p>
<p>I think the issue was that i had 32-bit ubuntu 16.04 operating system. I’m going to reinstall a 64 bit ubuntu 16.04 and see if that fixes the issue.</p>

<p>yes i think the default one that you download is 64 bit. otherwise you need to build it from the source if you want to do it in 32bit.</p>

<p>I doubt you can make current slicer work on an OS that old, but probably an old download would still run.</p>
