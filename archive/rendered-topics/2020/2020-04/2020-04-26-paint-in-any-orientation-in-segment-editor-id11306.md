<p>Hi there<br>
I was wondering whether I could paint slice of any orientation in segment editor. The three default views work just fine but I want to paint in other direction because some of my structure doesn’t display well in the default views.<br>
I’ve tried transfomation of volume,  but the segment painting is not transformed as what happened to the volume.<br>
Can anyone give me some advice? Thanks a lot.</p>

<p>The optimal solution depends on what you would like to achieve, but common solutions are described in this segmentation recipe: <a href="https://lassoan.github.io/SlicerSegmentationRecipes/ObliqueSliceSegmentation/">https://lassoan.github.io/SlicerSegmentationRecipes/ObliqueSliceSegmentation/</a></p>
