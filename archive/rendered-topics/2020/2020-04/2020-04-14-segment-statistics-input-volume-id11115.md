<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I am using segment statistics to extract data from VOIs in brain MR images including MPrage, T1 Post Gd, ADC, rBF, rBV, etc. However, I am not able to apply segment statistics for more than one input volume at the same time. I prefer to store min, mean, max, volume, etc of all maps in one table. I appreciate any guidance you could provide in this regard.</p>
<p>Regards,<br>
Parand</p>
