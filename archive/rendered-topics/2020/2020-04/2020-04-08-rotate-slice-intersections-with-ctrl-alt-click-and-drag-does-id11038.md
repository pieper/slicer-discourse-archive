<p>It appears that functionality was added March 10th 2019 (<a href="https://github.com/Slicer/Slicer/commit/f10e4916b6f4fbf1dd9e61b2f3317c5f5cee05fa" rel="nofollow noopener">this commit</a>) so you will have to download Slicer 4.11 Preview (<a href="https://download.slicer.org/" rel="nofollow noopener">https://download.slicer.org/</a>) to be able to use that as it was not included in Slicer 4.10.x versions.  You could use the Reformat module in Slicer 4.10.2 to achieve the same result of reslicing.</p>
