<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I’m trying to follow Kevin Alexander’s tutorial slideshow on Gel Dosimetry slicelet <a href="https://www.slicer.org/w/img_auth.php/c/c4/WC2015_Gel_slicelet_tutorial_final.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a><br>
and on the step with plotting the PDD etc (page 46) it just shows “plot data” and the plot appears. I cannot find any options to actually show the plot somewhere, I feel like I’ve tried every option. Does anyone have an idea of how to make this work?</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

<p>Could you try if it works well with latest Slicer Preview Release?</p>

<p>I’ll give that a shot, currently using 4.10.2 stable release.</p>
<p>Edit: The preview release made it work! Graph popped up as a new window no problem. Thank you!</p>
