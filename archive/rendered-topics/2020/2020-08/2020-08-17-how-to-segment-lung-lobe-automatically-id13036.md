<p>I need to computue the related  data of lung lobe, like the volume of each lobe. I have known that the module “Interactive lobe segmentation” in “Chest Imaging Platform (CIP)” can segment the lung lobe, but it isn’t automatical and I need to click a alot of points.</p>
<p>So I want to know does 3D Slicer have any other module to segment lung lobe automatically</p>
