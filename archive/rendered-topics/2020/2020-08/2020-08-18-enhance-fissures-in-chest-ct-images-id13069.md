<p>Hello Dear Developers and Users</p>
<p>Excuse me if the question is simple. I want to enhance fissures in chest CT images. What processes or pipeline should I do?</p>
<p>I see modules such as <strong>EnhanceFissuresInImage</strong>, but I do not fount contents for understanding it. I refer to <a href="https://chestimagingplatform.org/processing" rel="nofollow noopener">https://chestimagingplatform.org/processing</a>, but I did not understand anything. In this link, I did not found description about inputs in this module. Also I see processing modules such as <strong>GenerateMedianFilteredImage</strong> and <strong>GenerateNLMFilteredImage</strong>, But I do not know how to use them to enhance fissures and locate fiducials.</p>
<p>Please guide me.<br>
Shahrokh.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Did you have any progress in that point?<br>
I’m trying to find a way to quantify the fissure integrity.</p>
<p>Best regards</p>
