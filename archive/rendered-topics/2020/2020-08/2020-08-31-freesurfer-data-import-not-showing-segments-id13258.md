<p>I am running SlicerSALT 3.0 on my Macbook and using the FreeSurfer data import. When I choose the directories in Data Importer, all subjects show up but nothing shows up in the segments table. I downloaded SlicerSALT 2.1 and all the segments show up there, so it seems to just be a problem with 3.0.</p>
