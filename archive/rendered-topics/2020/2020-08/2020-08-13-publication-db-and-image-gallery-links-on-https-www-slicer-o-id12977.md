<p>While browsing the website (and looking for nice images to show a colleague) I sat that the publication and image gallery links in the sidebar on the main website point to a non-working target.<br>
This should probably be corrected.</p>

<p>Thanks for the report - this is a known issue but there’s been some delay getting it fixed.  Something about getting the right people to install a network jack.</p>
