<p>Hi<br>
We have a new Dell Precision 7540 mobile workstation and we just installed 3DSlicer.<br>
However, the screen was not displayed properly when we opened the 3DSlicer application.</p>
<p>We don’t have this display problem with other Dell older computers.<br>
Can anyone suggest what can we do for fixing this display problem?</p>
<p>Warm regards,<br>
Albert</p>

<p>Most probably you need to upgrade your graphics driver to the latest version. You may also need to choose to use the discrete nVidia graphics card to run SlicerApp-real.exe application.</p>
<p>If you still experience any issues then post a few screenshot about how things are not displayed properly.</p>
