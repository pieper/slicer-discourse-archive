<p>Posting on behalf of a user. He apparently installed the latest mac preview, but got this error message after trying to start Slicer.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>“Slicer” cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified. macOS cannot verify that this app is free from malware</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>What is the proper way to override this?</p>

<ol>
<li>Go find the app in Finder</li>
<li>Right click and say “Open”</li>
<li>When it says “this app can’t be opened” go ahead and hit cancel</li>
<li>Right click and say “Open” a second time. (Yeah, it’s like it didn’t listen the first time.)</li>
<li>Go ahead and click “Open anyway” or whatever it says.</li>
</ol>
<p>Off you go.</p>
<p>You can also go to the privacy/security settings in the control panel, I think, and override there.</p>
