<p>I installed the newest 3D Slicer 4.10.2 including Chest Imaging Platform,but I failed to run the software fallowing the PDF on Chest Imaging Platform’s web.</p>

<p>It seems that PDF is an older version with different features than the 4.10.2 version.<br>
In addition, can it do the automatic division of airway and lung lobe?</p>

<p>Hi -</p>
<p>I’m not a real expert in CIP, but I checked and the extension is available for the current nightly preview builds.</p>
<p>Under Chest Imaging Platform-&gt;Toolkit-&gt;Segmentation you’ll find a few modules that should do that.  Let us know how it goes for you.</p>
