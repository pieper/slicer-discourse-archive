<p>Hello,<br>
I created an stl file for the heart myocardium only using the tutorial :<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55cqpl8_b8c" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55cqpl8_b8c</a></p>
<p>However when i try to 3D print it , it still comes up as a solid 3D model instead of a hollowed out  heart. Could you kindly help? I am using the “Preform” software for the 3D printer.</p>

<p>You can use Hollow effect in Segment Editor module to create hollow segments.</p>
<p>Note that if you use a Formlabs printer then you need to add drain holes to allow excess resin to escape from cavities.</p>
