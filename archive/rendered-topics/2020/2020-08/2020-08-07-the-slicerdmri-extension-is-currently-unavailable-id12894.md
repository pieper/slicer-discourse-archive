<p>The builds look good on both versions.  Did you try installing via the Extension manager directly?</p>

<p>Thanks for your quick response,<br>
I actually tried but the webpage took long time to open and I decided not to continue, maybe because of my Internet connection. I will try again ASAP and come back to you weather I succes or not.</p>
