<p>Hello Slicers,</p>
<p>We are looking for a compact camera sensor for a hand held 3D scanning device. User of the device may not be able to scan the entire object in one scan and hence need build a functionality to stitch these scanned videos together to get the complete image. Any experience with such requirements? Do cameras come with such image stitching features? Any suggestions?</p>
<p>Regards,<br>
Satish</p>

<p>Depending on your budget the Artec 3D scanners have this functionality.</p>

<p>If you need accurate and robust scanning then I would recommend to get an Artec Eva scanner for about $20k. If you don’t need just surface shape, not color, then you can buy an Artec Eva Light for about $10k.</p>
<p>If you need something really cheap then you can just buy an Intel RealSense camera for <span class="math">150 and use a stitching software. We used a commercial software (the license was a few k</span>) and it worked OK, but there may be cheaper/free ones - maybe this one: <a href="https://www.lips-hci.com/lipscan">https://www.lips-hci.com/lipscan</a> (I haven’t tried it, so it would be great if you could try it and report back how well it works).</p>

<p>Thank you Andras. Very useful. I have reached out to Lipscan and will update if I get to experience their expertise/service.</p>
