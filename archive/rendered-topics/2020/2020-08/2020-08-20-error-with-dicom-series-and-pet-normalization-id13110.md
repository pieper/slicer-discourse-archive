<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I’m trying to calculate the radiomics features with pyradiomics in 3Dslicer. However, when i’m trying to normalize the DICOM series with PETDICOMExtension, i get a warning, which shows the following error: series does not have radiopharmaceutical code sequence.<br>
Is there a problem with my DICOM series?<br>
Can i calculate the radiomics features without normalizing the DICOM series?</p>
<p>Thanks for your help!!</p>
