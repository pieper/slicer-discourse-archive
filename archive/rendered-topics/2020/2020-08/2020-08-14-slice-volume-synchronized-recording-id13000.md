<p>Operating system: Windows 10<br>
Slicer version: 4.11.0<br>
Expected behavior: Want to record the axial slices going through the reconstructed volume as a movie.<br>
Actual behavior: Can only do it manually by moving the axial slices through the volume, but not being able to automate or record as as a movie.</p>
