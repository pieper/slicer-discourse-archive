<p>Hello everyone,<br>
I dowloaded Slicer 4.10.2. in this moning and I am so new in this software. I just would like to ask you that where I can add extra effect. When I watch some video on Youtube, I saw that their software have much more effect than mine such as Mask Volume.<br>
Thank you,</p>

<p>You will need to download the “SegmentEditorExtraEffects” extension.</p>
<p>See info on how to install extensions here: <a href="https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/Nightly/SlicerApplication/ExtensionsManager#Installing_an_extension" rel="nofollow noopener">https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/Nightly/SlicerApplication/ExtensionsManager#Installing_an_extension</a></p>
