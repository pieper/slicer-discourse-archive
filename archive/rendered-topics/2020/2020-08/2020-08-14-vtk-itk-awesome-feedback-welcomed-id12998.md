<p>Yesterday we (Kitware folks) hosted a brainstorming session on the potential, pitfalls, and technical options for integrating ITK and VTK.</p>
<p>In few weeks, after we materialize our plans we will reach to the community for input.</p>

<p><strong>Notes:</strong> It turns out I preemptively posted this, we will gather community feedback at a later time. To avoid confusion I also deleted a prior comment from <a class="mention" href="/u/cpinter">@cpinter</a> mentioning he had no access to the slides or blog.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Sorry for the confusion!   We are drafting a survey for the community that will hopefully be much more effective for gathering feedback, and it will be accompanied by a better description of our ideas.</p>
<p>As you may have guessed, there are many forces pushing for the tighter integration of ITK and VTK, and we just want to make certain we head in a direction with that integration that will have the greatest impact on our communities.    So, our upcoming poll is going to invite feedback from VTK, ITK, ParaView, 3D Slicer, and other groups.   As a result, it will take some time to craft, but we look forward to getting your feedback.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>
Stephen</p>
