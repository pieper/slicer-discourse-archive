<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>I’m wondering if there is a standardized yaml.-file or JSON which can be used for image preprocessing prior to running pyRadiomics extension. We have data from &gt; 16 CT scanners and were told that this would mitigate against image acquisition variation.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>
Aileen</p>

<p>Hello <a class="mention" href="/u/aileeno">@aileeno</a>,</p>
<p>There are some examples for configurations included in the PyRadiomics repository. You can find them <a href="https://github.com/Radiomics/pyradiomics/tree/master/examples/exampleSettings">here</a>.</p>
<p>HTH,</p>
