<p>What is the best method for segmenting the temporal bone from a CT for 3D printing? I’m having a lot of trouble with the mastoid air cells, there’s always a  hole in the pietrous part of the temporal all the way through the mastoid and out of the skull.<br>
I don’t know if this happens only because the resolution is poor, I’ve downloaded DICOM files trom TCIA and they are very old(1999, the newest is from 2003).<br>
Any advice is welcomed.<br>
Thank you.</p>
