<p>So I am thinking about hiring somoene to create a script that would repeat the same actions of importing the images, transforming them and exporting them and adding names to exported files.</p>
<p>I wonder how is it done in slicer?</p>
<ol>
<li>what language should this developer know?</li>
<li>is a plugin or a script requred?</li>
</ol>
<p>Thank you in advance and look forward to your responses</p>

<p>Python.</p>
<p>While C++ could be usable, too, it would be harder to keep it compatible with new Slicer versions.</p>

<p>You only need 3D Slicer and the custom script that you will get developed.</p>

<p>Do you know where one could find developers?</p>
<p>I talked to some guys on fiver and they told me they are not familiar with those concepts…</p>
<p>I tried to explain them what is volume and how images are loaded, they said they never did something similar like this.</p>
<p>Hmm</p>

<p>Also is there some way to record actions inside of Slicer and then to just repeat them with a simple click…</p>
<p>THAT WOULD tremendously help in the script because script would be extremely short and maybe not evne needed</p>

<p>I don’t see that “jobs” category… only “development” category</p>
