<p>This should be easy to do in recent Slicer Preview Releases, using Segment Editor module. You can change the master volume anytime. You can also copy/move segments between segmentations in Segmentations module.</p>
<p>If you need to spatially align images or segmentations then you can use one of the many registration methods available in Slicer.</p>
