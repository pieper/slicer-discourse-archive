<p>I am having an issue with my extension that for it to be upgraded the users need to upgrade the whole slicer. In the extension manager it does never happens to upgrade. Another possibility is to download the extension changing the build number and then install from file, this works but this is really annoying for users.</p>
<p>Is there a way to upgrade the extension without upgrading the whole Slicer or without having to download it manually?</p>

<p>For stable releases, extensions are rebuilt every night, so the behavior is exactly the one that you would want. We plan to release the new stable release (Slicer5) at the end of September.</p>
