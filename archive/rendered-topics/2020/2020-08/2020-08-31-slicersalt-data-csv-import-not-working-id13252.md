<p>My Mac SlicerSalt CSV Import button is not letting me type into the text box and no dialogue box appears when the CSV button is clicked.</p>

<p>If you want to import a folder, you might need to use the “import from folder” tab, instead the “import from CSV” tab.</p>
<p>The import from CSV tab is looking for a *.csv file that should include all the segmentation files including their full paths in a single column.</p>
<p>Hope that helps!<br>
