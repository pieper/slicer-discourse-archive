<p>When I try to use fiducial registration I always get the same error message:</p>
<p>Fiducial Registration standard error:<br>
Fixed and moving landmark lists must be of the same size and contain at least one point<br>
At least 3 fixed landmark fiducial points must be specified for Rigid or Similarity transforms, have 0</p>
<p>I’ve been using landmark registration to build lists of landmarks and entering them into fixed landmarks and moving landmarks in fiducial registration respectively. I’ve also tried to create new landmarks using “create new MarkupsFiducial” but can’t seem to figure out how to add points.</p>
<p>I apologize as I realize this is a pretty basic issue but I’m new to Slicer and can’t find any answers to this question. (I’m using 4.10.2 if that helps)  Any advice would be helpful!</p>
