<p>Operating system: Windows 10<br>
Slicer version: Latest version<br>
Expected behavior: Being able to place fiducials in surface cut module<br>
Actual behavior: i cannot use the surface cut module because the box for selecting fiducials is not clickable</p>

<p>I would recommend to switch to latest Slicer Preview Release, which does not have this issue.</p>
