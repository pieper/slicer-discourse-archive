<p>Does Slicer 4.11.0 have built in button options or Python commands to do the following(?):<br>
-Display orientation labels L/R &amp; A/P on the red slice or A/P &amp; H/F on the yellow slice</p>
<p>-Overlay printout of slider position in voxels on the red or yellow slice (eg white text on the very top of the red slice view that says “Slice 45 out of 50”). I am aware of the data probe, but I was hoping for something that would be more easy to interpret for my target end user.</p>
<p>-Change color of fiducial from create and place menu</p>
<p>-Also, can you actually obtain a measurement with the ruler from the create and place menu? If so, how?</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>
Rohan Nadkarni</p>
