<p>NIH just released this. While it is only a year, might be a useful chunk of change ($150K directs) with little work for existing grant holders (NCEs can’t apply).</p>

<p>Yes, a few of us had been looking at this - it seems quite specific in terms of the goal to update software for open science.  One approach that would be consistent with this call would be to port some existing software to work in Slicer so that the software could take advantage of the nightly builds, testing, support etc plus all the other features of Slicer.</p>
