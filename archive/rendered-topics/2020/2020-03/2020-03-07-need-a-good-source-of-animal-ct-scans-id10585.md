<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>Been using Slicer for a long time but first time posting here. I am looking for a good source of CT scans obtained from animals such as cows, horses, dogs, pigs etc. Trying to see how well I can use slicer to generate segmented models of animals for Veterinary Science applications. Any help is much appreciated!</p>
