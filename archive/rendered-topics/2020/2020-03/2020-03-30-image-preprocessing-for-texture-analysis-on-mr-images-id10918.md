<p>Hi,<br>
I´m wondering if there is a tutorial or recommendations on how to perform preprocessing on MR images for later texture analysis. Which modules should be used for:</p>
<p>Interpolation- Especially for 3D segmentation to obtain isotropic image resolution</p>
<p>Normalization- e.g Intensity normalization. Is it possible to perform “±3σ normalization”?</p>
<p>Is it possible to perform Inhomogeneity correction and Quantization of gray levels with 3D Slicer?</p>
<p>Do you think such preprocessing steps are necessary when performing texture analysis exclusively on images obtained from the same scanner after a standard protocol.</p>
<p>Thank you all!</p>

<p>Did you get clarity on these questions with the link provided? I have similar questions and would like to know how you had solved them</p>
