<p>The preview release links at <a href="https://download.slicer.org/" rel="nofollow noopener">https://download.slicer.org/</a> haven’t been updated since the 16th.</p>

<p>We (<a class="mention" href="/u/jcfr">@jcfr</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/lassoan">@lassoan</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/mhalle">@mhalle</a> et al) are working on sorting out the issue.  It is related to the way the download site uses the revision number to look up the most recent build.</p>

<p>Is there an alternate location to download slicer from until this works again?</p>

<p>You can download from the <a href="http://slicer.cdash.org/index.php?project=SlicerPreview">dashboard</a> - except <a href="https://github.com/Slicer/Slicer/issues/4756">Windows builds, which only show up on Midas</a>.</p>
<p>Extensions are not available either, but that <a href="https://github.com/Slicer/Slicer/issues/4759">should work by tomorrow</a>.</p>
<p>We understand the <a href="https://github.com/Slicer/Slicer/issues/4757">download page is issue</a> is urgent. Just know that <a class="mention" href="/u/mhalle">@mhalle</a> is working on it and will post an update when it is addressed.</p>
<p>We also acknowledge this situation highlights the importance of Slicer core developers to have access to all parts of the build, test, and distribution infrastructure. We cannot afford anything to depend on a single person and will be working on improving the infrastructure.</p>

<p>The Windows builds on Midas can be found using the search function, example: <a href="http://slicer.kitware.com/midas3/search/index?q=Slicer-4.11.0-2020-03-22-win-amd64.exe" rel="nofollow noopener">http://slicer.kitware.com/midas3/search/index?q=Slicer-4.11.0-2020-03-22-win-amd64.exe</a></p>
