<p>When I downloaded the version 4.10.2 and installed all the extensions, I can’t open the software and the system showed me the information “the application was unable to start correctly (0Xc0000017).Click OK to close the application. The software can’t be performed again until I deleted the data of “slicer-28257.ini” in the folder of NA-MIC. But the extensions need to install again. I want to know how to solve this bug?<div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://us1.discourse-cdn.com/flex002/uploads/slicer/original/3X/a/1/a19fa418fdb68b77048c706f5dc19f2496a5fdd4.jpeg" data-download-href="/uploads/short-url/n3MTVmQyDjLULuIzImtqEBqBKpS.jpeg?dl=1" title="新建图像 1" rel="noopener nofollow ugc"><img src="https://us1.discourse-cdn.com/flex002/uploads/slicer/optimized/3X/a/1/a19fa418fdb68b77048c706f5dc19f2496a5fdd4_2_690x384.jpeg" alt="新建图像 1" data-base62-sha1="n3MTVmQyDjLULuIzImtqEBqBKpS" width="690" height="384" srcset="https://us1.discourse-cdn.com/flex002/uploads/slicer/optimized/3X/a/1/a19fa418fdb68b77048c706f5dc19f2496a5fdd4_2_690x384.jpeg, https://us1.discourse-cdn.com/flex002/uploads/slicer/optimized/3X/a/1/a19fa418fdb68b77048c706f5dc19f2496a5fdd4_2_1035x576.jpeg 1.5x, https://us1.discourse-cdn.com/flex002/uploads/slicer/original/3X/a/1/a19fa418fdb68b77048c706f5dc19f2496a5fdd4.jpeg 2x" data-dominant-color="4DA6B1"><div class="meta"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use href="#far-image"></use></svg><span class="filename">新建图像 1</span><span class="informations">1096×611 56.4 KB</span><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use href="#discourse-expand"></use></svg></div></a></div></p>

<p>Most likely you have run out of memory, or an extension worked incorrectly.</p>
<p>Normally you would only install extensions that you actually need. If you have a problem with any specific extension then let us know.</p>
