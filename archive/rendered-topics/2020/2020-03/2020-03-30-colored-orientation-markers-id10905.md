<p>Operating system: Windows 10<br>
Slicer version: 4.11.0-2020-02-20<br>
Expected behavior: import a colored model to use as an orientation marker<br>
Actual behavior: model is imported in single color</p>
<p>I’m interested in importing models with colors that help the user to understand the region of interest.  For example, we’ve created some 3D models of arms and head/neck with color patches to indicate an area of injury or the right vs left carotid artery in the neck.  We painted these in Microsoft 3D Paint.  However, when imported, they are a single grey shade, which can be reassigned a new color in the models module.</p>
<p>I looked up documentation on the STL and OBJ file types and saw that these do not encode colors.</p>
<p>However, the default human orientation figure in Slicer is multiple colors, and is saved as a .VTP.  I reimported this as a model, but it appears as a grey shade also.</p>
<p>Any guidance would be fantastic.</p>
