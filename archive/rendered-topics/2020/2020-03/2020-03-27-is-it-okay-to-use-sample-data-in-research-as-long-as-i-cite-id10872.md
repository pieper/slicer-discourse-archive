<p>Operating system: Windows<br>
Slicer version: 4.10.2</p>
<p>So I’m in medical school, working on a project. I’d like to use the MRI brain sample data, am I allowed to do that, legally, as long as I cite slicer v4?  I have looked everywhere to find this out, but can’t figure it out. I tend to lean towards “yes” because it says open-source everywhere, but I wanted to double check.</p>

<p>Thanks for checking - short answer is yes, you can use the data and yes, it’s correct to cite your sources in any publication.</p>
<p>The details are in the <a href="https://github.com/Slicer/Slicer/blob/master/License.txt">license agreement here</a> which covers both code and data.</p>
