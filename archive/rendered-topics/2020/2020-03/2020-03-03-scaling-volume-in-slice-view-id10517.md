<p>Hi developers, I have a problem about scaling an image in slice view. I’m working on dynamic pelvic floor images and trying to get the rest and strain images of the same person to be the same size in slicer.<br>
Is there anyway to scale a slice view? ( Import a jpg image as a volume and try to scale it in the 2D slice view. )<br>
Thanks!</p>

<p>It sounds like you want to set the spacing on the volume node.  This can be done in the Volume Information tab of the Volumes module.</p>
