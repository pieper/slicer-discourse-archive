<p>Hello everyone! We have the Stratasys objet260 printer and we tried to make a model based on bitmap images. We exported from SlicerFab and converted all images by Floyd–Steinberg dithering algorithm. Could anyone give us some suggestions what should we do next? Thank you！</p>

<p>You need to contact Stratasys about how to pass these bitmaps to your printer.</p>
