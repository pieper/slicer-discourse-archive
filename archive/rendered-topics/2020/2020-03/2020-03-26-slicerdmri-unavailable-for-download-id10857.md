<p>See <a href="https://discourse.slicer.org/t/no-mac-extensions-today-2020-03-26/10850" class="inline-onebox">No mac extensions today - 2020-03-26</a>. You may need to wait a few hours for the extensions to be built for Mac or install <a href="https://download.slicer.org/?date=2020-03-25">yesterday’s Slicer Preview Release</a>.</p>
