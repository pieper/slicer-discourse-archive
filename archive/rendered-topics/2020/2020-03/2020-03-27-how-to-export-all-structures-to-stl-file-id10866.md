<p>Hi everyone</p>
<p>I’ll ask you to how to export the dicom slice.</p>
<p>I implemented as follows.</p>
<ol>
<li>A Dicom file containing the structure(OAR, spinal cord, eye… etc) was imported into the 3D slicer from Varian Eclipse.</li>
<li>The segment editor confirmed that the structure was normally recalled.</li>
<li>Export to save the STL file and import the autodesk Netfabb</li>
<li>But In the loaded Dicom files , only the surface of the bones and body is visible, but no other structures are visible.!<br>
I’d like to print 3D like the attached picture (section), is there anything wrong with what I did? I’d like to hear your explanation in detail.</li>
</ol>
<p>I think it would be better to reply by e-mail. <a href="mailto:dnssll1009@naver.com">dnssll1009@naver.com</a><br>
