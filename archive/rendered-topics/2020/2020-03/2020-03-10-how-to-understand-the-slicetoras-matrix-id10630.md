<p>Hello,</p>
<p>It seems that there are a lot of coordinate systems involved in Slicer. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/grinning.png?v=9" title=":grinning:" class="emoji" alt=":grinning:"><br>
I was trying to find a tutorial explaining the different coordinate systems and transformations among each other, however, failed to find a good one.</p>
<p>Specifically,</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>How many Coordinate Systems (CSs) are involved Slicer?  (e.g., IJK, XYZ, SliceNode? VolumeNode? RAS? LAS, LPI, RPI…)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How are those CSs employed in Slicer? (e.g., what exactly is a coordinate of Slice? and what does the matrix of SliceToRAS do?)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any resource or tutorial that explains how the principles of different transformation matrixes mathematically?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Thank you very much!</p>

<p>Hi -</p>
<p>This is a good place to start: <a href="https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Coordinate_systems">https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Coordinate_systems</a></p>

<p>Thank you for providing this link, Pieper!</p>
<p>Yes, that is a good place to start; though it could not answer my questions systematically. <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:"></p>
