<p>Ubuntu 18.04, fresh install. Downloaded appimage v4.10 of 3D slicer which gives error</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">error: Failed to obtain launcher executable name !
</code></pre>
<p>when launched from terminal (same for v4.11 preview).</p>
<p>Problem has already been reported here:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://discourse.slicer.org/t/cant-launch-slicer-on-linux/2694" class="inline-onebox">Can't launch Slicer on Linux!</a></li>
<li><a href="https://discourse.slicer.org/t/pre-build-or-locally-build-3dslicer-under-ubuntu-16-04-does-not-start-failed-to-obtain-launcher-executable-name/2322/3" class="inline-onebox">Pre-build or Locally-build 3dSlicer under Ubuntu 16.04 does NOT start: Failed to obtain launcher executable name!</a></li>
</ul>
<p>with only solution of getting back to v4.8 version. Tried it too, doesn’t work.</p>
<p>Is there a fix planned in a future version?</p>
