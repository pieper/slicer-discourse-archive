<p>There is an interesting medical imaging conference coming up, called <a href="https://web.cvent.com/event/8163cd94-e6b2-46a4-b592-44d667bd64fb/summary">From Cells to Galaxies</a>. The goal of this conference is to build bridges from two synergistic fields: Radioastronomy and Medical Imaging. I believe it is an important scientific exercise that should happen way more between disciplines, in order we can accelerate discoveries across the board.</p>
<p>The organizers are still seeking for relevant abstracts to be submitted and presented there. Please find the <a href="https://go.nrao.edu/C2G2020">CfP here</a>. Registration is open until April 13.</p>
<p>If you have any questions, please email the organizers at <a href="mailto:C2G2@nrao.edu">C2G2@nrao.edu</a> directly.</p>

<p><a class="mention" href="/u/davide_punzo">@Davide_Punzo</a> it seems that SlicerAstro could be a good fit for this conference.</p>

<p>Thanks for the ping Andras. SlicerAstro would be indeed a good fit. Unfortunately, I don’t have the traveling funds for it at the moment. I guess the NRAO already did, but I can share the post link to my previous HI radioastronomy group in NL, somebody may be interested.</p>
