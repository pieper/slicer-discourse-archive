# Radiomics: Is it possible to import DICOM image and a binary mask as a segmentation to extract features?

<p>I have a DICOM image along with a binary mask of the segmented region generated by another software. I noticed that Radiomics reads an Input Image Volume and Input Regions. Is there any way to use a volumetric (DICOM) binary mask as an Input Region? Or should I create a contour by, for example, a region growing or thresholding of the binary mask?</p>

<p>PyRadiomics (optionally available through the SlicerRadiomics extension) uses binary masks to identify the regions of interest, so you don’t need to define a contour. The only requirement in PyRadiomics as standalone is that both image and mask are single files, readable by SimpleITK.</p>
<p>If you use the SlicerRadiomics extension, if you load both the image and mask, you can select them (the mask should either be loaded as a labelmap (legacy support) or a segmentation).</p>
