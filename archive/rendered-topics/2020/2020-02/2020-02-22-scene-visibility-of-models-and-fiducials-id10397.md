<p>I use Q3DC and Angle plane modules. First, I must choose scene for create the the plane or landmark but I don’t know how to create scene. Should I go to create this on the other modules before go to Q3DC or Angle plane?</p>

<p>Your scene will come from loading data files into Slicer. This can be as easy as clicking and dragging an appropriate file into Slicer.</p>
