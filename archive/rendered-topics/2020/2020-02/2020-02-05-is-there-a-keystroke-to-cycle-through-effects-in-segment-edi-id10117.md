<p>From the docs it appears that numerals are used to shortcut different effects. Would it be possible to add two keystrokes which cycle through the effects left and right (much like the f/g combination for slice views).</p>
<p>Perhaps ` and ~</p>

<p>I added <a href="https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/Nightly/ScriptRepository#Customize_keyboard_shortcuts">a repository example</a> for cycling through effects as needed for SlicerMorph.</p>
