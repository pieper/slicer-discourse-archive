<p>Hi, i have to segment fetal bone and measure their volume, surface area and length. Thanks to Segmentation statistics i can have access to the volume and the surface area of segmented bones, however i don’t find a way to measure the length of bones in a reproductible way. Ideally a bounding box which imprisons the bone and gives its maximum length will be great. But i don’t find a tool like this in 3D slicer. This is why I’m turning to you. I’m new to this software.  So, if you have any idea to do this, i will be greatly thankful to have your help.</p>

<p>We recently added oriented bounding box size computation - see this topic for details: <a href="https://discourse.slicer.org/t/new-segment-statistics-oriented-bounding-box-diameter-and-more/10203" class="inline-onebox">New Segment Statistics: Oriented Bounding Box, Diameter and More</a></p>
