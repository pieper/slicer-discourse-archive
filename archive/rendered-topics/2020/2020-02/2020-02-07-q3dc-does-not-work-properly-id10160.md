<p>Problem report for Slicer 4.10.2 macosx-amd64: [please describe expected and actual behavior]<br>
The fudicial I put on the sample is not fixed. I keeps moving even though I don’t choose any fudicial in “selected landmarks”  Also, the landmark is not on surface even though I check “on surface” box.<br>
I’ve already tried uninstalled Slicer and Q3DC, but the problem stayed the same.</p>
