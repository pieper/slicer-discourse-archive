<p>Hi <a class="mention" href="/u/cpinter">@cpinter</a> and <a class="mention" href="/u/lassoan">@lassoan</a>,</p>
<p>I am writing a manuscript where the methods are heavily based on SlicerRT.<br>
I am citing your 2012 Medical Physics paper, for sure.<br>
But I was wondering if any other papers have come out in the meantime which validate in some way the planning, calculation, etc functionalities of SlicerRT.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>Stephan</p>

<p>Thank you for the question and the consideration!</p>
<p>The dose comparison (gamma) algorithm is validated in this paper:<br>
Alexander, K. M., Pinter, C., Fichtinger, G., Olding, T., &amp; Schreiner, L. J. (2018). Streamlined open-source gel dosimetry analysis in 3D slicer.  <em>Biomedical Physics &amp; Engineering Express</em> ,  <em>4</em> (4), 045041.</p>
<p>I can’t think of any other formal validation done other than that of the DVH in the 2012 paper you mention and that of the gamma here above.</p>
