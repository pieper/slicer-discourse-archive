<p>Are you using Slicer to create datasets for Machine Learning?<br>
Do you find it cumbersome to distribute dataset creation tasks to fellow-radiologists and then collecting results from them in one place?</p>
<p>Please reach out to me, I have created a Slicer-plugin that provides 20X speedup for ML-dataset creation using Slicer.</p>

<p>This is direct advertising of your commercial product. Some of such posts might be tolerable if they also serve the interest of the Slicer community.</p>
<p>However, the product does not seem to be open-source (so any kind of collaboration with the Slicer community would be really hard) and there is no obvious connection to 3D Slicer (other than you try to offer a very different/limited alternative to Slicer’s Segment Editor for a fee).</p>
<p>If you can explain how Slicer community would benefit from your work then this topic may remain but otherwise I’m afraid we need to unlist it.</p>

<p>Andras, the plugin will be open source once it is released. Right now I am only trying to understand full set of features that potential users would want. Because I have not released the plugin yet, this post is not advertisement of a product. If you still deem this post adv, it is your call.<br>
I donot intend to offer alternative to Segment Editor. I intend to offer easier collaboration around segment editor. I can show you a demo video call.  Thanks</p>

<p>OK, let’s unlist this topic then and if you have a good idea for making Segment Editor available for distributed annotation via a web browser then start a new topic. Several groups are working on various solutions for this already, but it does not hurt to openly explore various alternatives.</p>

<p>Np, Would you be willing to share what groups are working on distributed annotation, so that I can consult with them?</p>

<p>Sure, just post whatever you would like to collaborate on and people who are interested will join the discussion.</p>
