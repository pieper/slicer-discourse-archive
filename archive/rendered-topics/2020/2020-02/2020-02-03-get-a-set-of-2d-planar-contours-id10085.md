<p>Hi;</p>
<p>I have a sert of IRM images of brain, i used segment editor to segment ROI using (manually or semi-automatic segmentation ) but even the segment tool, i obtained Always a label Map as master representation.</p>
<p>What I need is a set of 2d planar contours (as master represntation). I know that i must install slicerRt extension. but i Don’t know the differents steps to get the set of 2d planar contours.</p>
<p>I found a few examples but about CT images, however, I have IRM images of brain.</p>
<p>my question is what are the differents steps to segment the set of IRM images and get only a set of 2d planar contours whatever using slicer3d or SlicerRT?</p>
