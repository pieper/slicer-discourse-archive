<p>Now that <code>slicer.util.pip_install</code> has streamlined the installation of python packages, I’d like to revisit <a href="https://discourse.slicer.org/t/automatic-install-of-python-packages/7078">the conversation</a> on automated installation of python packages.</p>
<p>We’d like to have users install a few python packages after installing the SlicerMorph extension through the Extension Manager. Is there a way to require them as dependencies?</p>

<p>Hi <a class="mention" href="/u/smrolfe">@smrolfe</a> - did you see <a href="https://discourse.slicer.org/t/install-python-library-with-extension/10110/2">the options in this discussion</a>?  One of those approaches would work I think.</p>
