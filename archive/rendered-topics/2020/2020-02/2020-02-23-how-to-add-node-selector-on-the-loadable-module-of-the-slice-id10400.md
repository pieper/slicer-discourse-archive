<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I have developed script module (Python module) of the Slicer for my research.</p>
<p>Recently, I have started to develop new module with loadable module (C++ module) for the new purpose.</p>
<p>But, I have faced to the problem to add node selector for the model node and volume node on the module.</p>
<p>Although it was pretty simple on the script module, it’s more complicate to add them on the loadable module.</p>
<p>Would you let me know how to add and use them for the loadable module or where I can get the example for them.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>You can find many examples of how various GUI widgets are used in loadable modules in Slicer’s source code (Modules/Loadable folder).</p>
