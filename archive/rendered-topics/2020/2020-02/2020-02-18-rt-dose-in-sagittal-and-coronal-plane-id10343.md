<p>Hello everyone,<br>
I am trying to overlay rt dose and rt structure from axial plane into sagittal and coronal plane images in python. I did not find how it is done in slicer rt, can anyone help me to find/undestand how it works?</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>With SlicerRT you should be able to do these quite easily. To get familiar with 3D Slicer and SlicerRT, I would recommend to start with a few <a href="https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/Nightly/Training#Quick_Start_Guide">basic Slicer tutorials</a> and then continue with <a href="https://www.slicer.org/w/index.php/Documentation/Nightly/Extensions/SlicerRT#Tutorials">SlicerRT tutorials</a>. If you have any specific questions then you can post them here.</p>
