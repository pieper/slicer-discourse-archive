<p>I’ve known a solution for decrypting GE 3D images using Image3dAPI. Have you heard of these solution? Is it compatible with 3D slicer?<br>
So far I couldn’t load GE dicom images with 3D slicer.</p>

<p>Yes, we know quite a lot about different GE 3D image formats. What imaging modality are you trying to load - CT, CBCT, ultrasound? Can you provide a phantom or anonymized example data set that you have problem with?</p>

<p>It’s US (not a kretz US dicom ) it’s from the vivid line of 3D US.</p>
