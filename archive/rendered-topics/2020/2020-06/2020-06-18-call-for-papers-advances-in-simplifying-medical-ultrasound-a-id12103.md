<p><strong>Advances in Simplifying Medical UltraSound (ASMUS) – an inaugural workshop at MICCAI 2020</strong></p>
<p><em>Paper Submission Deadline: 30 June 2020</em></p>
<p>This inaugural workshop aims to bring together the MICCAI research community working towards the next generation of medical ultrasound imaging methods and systems. We envisage a future for clinical ultrasound that truly combines advances both in medical image computing (MIC) and computer-assisted intervention (CAI), acknowledging the unique imaging modality operated directly by human operators, or in the future, robotic systems. As a research community, we will design and implement new ultrasound-enabled applications to provide revolutionary healthcare benefits.</p>
<p>This full-day workshop will have an inter-disciplinary flavour, and will review, publish and discuss latest findings in this area with participants from academia, industry and clinical practice. A key feature of the workshop will be live demonstrations, capitalising on the unique portability of ultrasound-based applications. Accepted full-length manuscripts will be published with Springer LNCS, with an option to provide a live demonstration at the workshop.</p>
<p>Original research in the areas below are invited and proof-of-concept research from novel research directions are also encouraged.</p>
<p><em><strong>Ultrasound Assisted by Artificial Intelligence and Medical Robotics</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li>Ultrasound imaging with robotic (automated) assistance</li>
<li>Machine learning methods in ultrasound analysis and guidance</li>
<li>Automated interpretation and measurement for ultrasound</li>
<li>Ultrasound quality and skills assessment</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Multimodality Ultrasound Imaging</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li>Ultrasound with other non-imaging sensory information, e.g. positional and eye tracking</li>
<li>Ultrasound with another pre-/intra-procedural imaging, e.g. camera videos, CT, MR, fluorescence</li>
<li>Different modes of ultrasound imaging, e.g. photoacoustic, Doppler, compounding</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Applications</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li>For global healthcare</li>
<li>For training sonographers and other users</li>
<li>For assisting non-expert healthcare professionals</li>
<li>For other point-of-care ultrasound systems and scenarios</li>
<li>For assisting surgery and interventions</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key Dates</strong></p>
<p>Submission Deadline 30 June 2020</p>
<p>Notification of Acceptance 21 July 2020</p>
<p>Camera Ready Papers 31 July 2020</p>
<p>Workshop 04 October 2020</p>
<p><strong>Workshop Chairs</strong></p>
<p>Yipeng Hu (University College London)</p>
<p>Alison Noble (University of Oxford)</p>
<p>Stephen Aylward (Kitware)</p>
<p><strong>Organising Committee</strong></p>
