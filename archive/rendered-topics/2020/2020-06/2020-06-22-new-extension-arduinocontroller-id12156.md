<p>Dear all,<br>
I am delighted to announce a new Slicer extension: ArduinoController.<br>
It can be installed by using the extension manager of any nightly version of Slicer.</p>
<p>By using this extension it is possible to send and receive data from Arduino boards.</p>
<p>The GUI offers the possibility to send messages and to show/plot the data coming from the microcontroller.<br>
If the user wants to develop his own application, sending and receiving data from Arduino, this can be done via python code.<br>
<a href="https://pzaffino.github.io/SlicerArduinoController/" rel="nofollow noopener">This</a> is the webpage of the project, that includes also a basic documentation.</p>
<p>Any feedback is more than welcomed and we hope this extension could help your work.</p>
<p>Finally, we would like to thank how provided important suggestions (<a class="mention" href="/u/davide_punzo">@Davide_Punzo</a> and <a class="mention" href="/u/pieper">@pieper</a> in principal), as well as all the people that attended the breakout session during the last project week.</p>
<p>Paolo Zaffino on behalf of all the contributors.</p>

<p>Very interesting.<br>
It could be used in custom 3D navigation projects…</p>

<p>I love Arduinos - I will have to think up ways to use this…</p>
<p>Great addition, thanks!</p>

<p>Digitization? Do arduinos support cameras?</p>

<p>The idea is to use Arudino for fast (and cheap) prototyping, educational purpose and not “complex” tasks.<br>
For 3D navigation I would definitely suggest something like SlicerIGT.</p>

<p>Yes, Arduino supports camera.<br>
Honestly I never thought to use Arduino for 2D signals…but, I mean, it’s something possible!</p>
