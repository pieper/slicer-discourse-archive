<p>Good afternoon,</p>
<p>From a dicom, I generate a model of the skeleton. For the muscles, I do them through Blender, a free 3D software that uses Python, It allows to control the topology and to keep it light.</p>
<p>I tried to use ‘OrtogOnBlender’; an addon that allows to open dicoms within blender, but there is very few documentation about it and the program keeps evolving sothat the buttons can not always be found as in the tutorials.</p>
<p>I just wanted to know if somebody had an advice about sources, ways to work, etc.</p>
