<p>Hi developpers,<br>
Is it possible with a python script to display two 3D scenes side by side and apply the same camera rotations, translations or zoom using the mouse (as with a single 3D view) ?<br>
My goal is to compare side by side two volumes.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for your help.</p>
<p>Best</p>

<p>You can enable “link” between 3D views to make them all translate/rotate/zoom in sync:</p>
