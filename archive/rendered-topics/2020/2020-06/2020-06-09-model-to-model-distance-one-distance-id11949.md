<p>Operating system: Windows 10 Pro<br>
Slicer version: 4.10.2<br>
Expected behavior: calculate distance between model in specific region<br>
Actual behavior: I have a ultrasound volume with Volume S and Volume T segmented. with model to model distance, I can computed the distance and show it in a colormap. However, I want the closest distance between the two margins but only computed at one side. This, because Volume T is at the surface of Volume S, so the clostest margin will be 0. But I want the closest margin to the surface at the other side of Volume S.</p>
<p>Is there a way to select a region of the surface of Volume S, to compute to closest distance?</p>
<p>Thank you very much!</p>
