<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am using Slicer version 4.11.0-2020-06-06 and not able to adjust the contrast and brightness for images using the mouse pad.  I was able to do this on Slicer 4.10.2.  How can I fix this?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Vinny</p>

<p>Window/level interaction has been changed in 4.11, see: <a href="https://discourse.slicer.org/t/recent-improvements-in-window-level-management/7284" class="inline-onebox">Recent improvements in window/level management</a></p>
