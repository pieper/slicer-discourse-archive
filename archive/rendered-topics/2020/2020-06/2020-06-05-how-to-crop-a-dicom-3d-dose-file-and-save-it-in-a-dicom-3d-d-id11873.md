<p>Hi every one,</p>
<p>I am cropping a DICOM dose file (single file) and then save it in a single DICOM dose file as well (not a DICOM series).</p>
<p>I have a DICOM 3D dose (single file) file that inputs to 3D Slicer, then I crop it by “crop volume” module → save it as .nrrd file. The .nrrd file continues converting to DICOM file? in here I used “create a DICOM series”, but I want it is saved as a single DICOM dose file (as the original file).</p>
<p>Can anyone please let me how can I do that?</p>
<p>Thank so much.</p>
