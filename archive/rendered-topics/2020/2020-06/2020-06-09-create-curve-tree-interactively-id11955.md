<p>This question is probably specifically for Andras (<a class="mention" href="/u/lassoan">@lassoan</a>), but someone else might know how to do this.</p>
<p>Your video on centerline extraction and tree creation is awesome, but I was wondering if there is a way to interactively create a curve tree - meaning, make a hierarchy similar to the one shown in your video, but by hand by placing points interactively.</p>
<p>Thanks!!</p>

<p>Never mind - I think I got it. Just needed another 10 mins or so playing with the UI.</p>

<p>Note that you can also extract centerline for a simple straight segment using the built-in Extract skeleton module.</p>
