<p>Operating system: Windows 10<br>
Slicer version: 4.10.2<br>
Expected behavior: Uploaded DICOM Files<br>
Actual behavior: No DICOM datasets load to the program</p>
<p>I am having trouble uploading my DICOM files (RA64) to the 3D Slicer DICOM Browser. For one scan, I have 1017 files, each 1510KB. I think there may be some metadata in the file’s title making them incompatible with 3D Slicer. Has anyone had this issue/found a solution?</p>
