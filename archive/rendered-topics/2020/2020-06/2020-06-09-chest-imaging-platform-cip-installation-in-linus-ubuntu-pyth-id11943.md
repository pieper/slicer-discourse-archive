<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I need small help for the Chest Imaging Platform (CIP) installation in Linus Ubuntu &amp; python set up and looking for the installation steps.</p>
<p>Basically I would like to use the “GeneratePartialLungLabelMap” function in my main python code for whole lung segmentation.</p>
<p>Please provide me the steps for instalation</p>
<p>CIP git repository is provided at - <a href="https://github.com/acil-bwh/ChestImagingPlatform" rel="nofollow noopener">https://github.com/acil-bwh/ChestImagingPlatform</a>.</p>
<p>I am not sure which version of CIP - need to install for my whole lung segmentation. As it has two options for download - 1) CIP Library, 2) Slicer CIP</p>
<p>Please advise me.</p>
<p>Shiva</p>

<p>Hi - <a class="mention" href="/u/shahrokh">@shahrokh</a> <a href="https://discourse.slicer.org/t/error-message-when-running-slicercip/11897">reported that using 4.8.1</a> worked.  Older releases <a href="http://slicer.kitware.com/midas3/folder/274">are available on the midas server</a>.</p>
<p>CIP had some build errors with recent Slicer but I believe the nightly will work soon.</p>
