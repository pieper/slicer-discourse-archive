<p>I’m an undergrad student using Slicer to model soybean nodules. I’ve been segmenting the data and saving them as .mrb files. I’m able to generate a 3D preview, but have not been able to figure out how to generate a file that can be printed out of a 3D model.</p>
<p>Thank you all for any help!</p>

<p>This section of the Segmentations module documentation should help: <a href="https://slicer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/modules/segmentations.html#export-segmentation-to-model-surface-mesh-file">https://slicer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/modules/segmentations.html#export-segmentation-to-model-surface-mesh-file</a></p>
