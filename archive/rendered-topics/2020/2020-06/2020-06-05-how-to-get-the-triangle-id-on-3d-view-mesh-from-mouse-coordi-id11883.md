<p>Hi;</p>
<p>I want to know if is it possible to obtain the triangle ID (the closest one) when I click on a segmented area  in 2D slice view? Can you give me some examples or classes to that in c++.</p>
<p>thank’s in advance</p>

<p>You can find a complete example in the script repository: <a href="https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/Nightly/ScriptRepository#Select_cells_of_a_model_using_markups_fiducial_points">https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/Nightly/ScriptRepository#Select_cells_of_a_model_using_markups_fiducial_points</a></p>
