<hr>
<p>MICCAI’20 SHAPEMI</p>
<p>Workshop on Shape Analysis in Medical Imaging</p>
<p><a href="https://shapemi.github.io/" class="onebox" target="_blank">https://shapemi.github.io/</a></p>
<hr>
<p>(*) Description</p>
<p>We gladly announce the second workshop for Shape Analysis in Medical Imaging (SHAPEMI, <a href="https://shapemi.github.io/">https://shapemi.github.io/</a>) held in conjunction with MICCAI – Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Interventions, as a virtual event on (or around) Oct 4, 2020.</p>
<p>(*) Aim and Scope</p>
<p>Shape and geometry methods are at the core of multiple applications and novel technologies in medical imaging.</p>
<p>This workshop provides a presentation venue for researchers working in shape and geometrical analysis, such as shape modeling, geometric learning and statistics. We focus on (i) shape methods, (ii) applications and (iii) software packages.</p>
<p>Original contributions as well as exciting applications in medical imaging are sought in the form of:</p>
<ul>
<li>8-12 page papers (excluding references and acknowledgements)</li>
</ul>
<p>We plan on publishing a workshop proceedings with accepted full papers in Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS). Please note that at least one co-author must register to the workshop by the early bird registration deadline August 17, 2020.</p>
<p>(*) Topics include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Shape Processing and Analysis</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shape Learning and Classification</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Geometric Learning and Manifold-based Methods</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Statistics of Shapes and Deformations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Spectral Shape Analysis</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Spectral Clustering and Dimensionality Reduction</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shape Modeling and Representation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shape Segmentation, Registration and Correspondence</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Longitudinal Shape Analysis and Processing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Medical Applications focused on Shape Analysis</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Evaluation / quality assessment of shape models</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Relevant demos of freely available shape analysis software</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Keynotes will be announced soon.</p>
<p>(*) Tentative Format:</p>
<p>This year ShapeMI will happen virtually. Details will follow, currently we plan a mix of pre-recorded and live sessions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Presentation: Accepted papers will have to pre-record a short (probably 10 or 15 min) presentation that will be due two weeks before the workshop. The idea is to make these talks available to the attendees in advance of the workshop, but we need to wait what MICCAI plans.</li>
<li>Summary-Slide: Furthermore, a one-slide summary of the paper (PDF) needs to be submitted together with the recorded talks.</li>
<li>Live-Session: The summary slide will be shown for featured papers during a live pitch on Oct. 4th. We plan a couple minutes for the live presentation followed by a short Q&amp;A session.</li>
</ul>
<p>This workshop will provide an invaluable opportunity for researchers to present recent work on shape analysis in medical imaging. Interactions during the live portion will provide feed-back, insights and networking opportunities.</p>
<p>A Best Paper Award is sponsored by the <a href="http://miccai.org/special-interest-groups/shape-modeling-and-analysis/">Special Interest Group in Shape Analysis.</a></p>
<p>** IMPORTANT DATES **</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Full paper deadline: (previously June 30) !!! Extended: July 6, 2020; 11:59 PM PST !!!</p>
</li>

</li>
<li>
<p>MICCAI early registration: August 17, 2020</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Camera-ready version due: August 21, 2020</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pre-recorded talks and summary slide due: around September 20th</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pre-recorded talks released: around September 27th</p>

<p>Dear Beatriz,</p>
<p>Thank you for your post. I cannot find the link to sign up for the conference? Also, does it include teaching sessions for shape analysis?</p>
<p>Have a great one.</p>
<p>Cheers from Australia!<br>
Jas Coles-Black</p>

<p>Hi Jas,</p>
<p>The website is <a href="http://shapemi.github.io">shapemi.github.io</a>.<br>
It definitely will include some level of teaching. Please stay tuned <a href="https://shapemi.github.io/program/">to the program page.</a></p>
<p>There is a SlicerSALT shape analysis workshop online here <a href="https://vimeo.com/412300712">[1]</a> <a href="https://vimeo.com/412356243">[2]</a> <a href="https://vimeo.com/412373481">[3]</a> <a href="https://vimeo.com/412382491">[4]</a></p>
