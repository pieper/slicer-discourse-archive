<p>Hello, I have attempted to request an account to add the wiki page for my extension ~6 months ago and never heard back. I also never received a confirmation email that I was instructed I would receive. I have just tried again to request an account using a different email, and I still did not receive the email confirmation. If I try to request an account using the same email, it tells me that I have already attempted to make an account with that email, although the email confirmation is nowhere in my inbox, including spam. Can anyone please advise on the best way to proceed? Thank you.</p>

<p>Hi - thanks for reporting - there was some older documentation that suggested using the wiki, but then the wiki was not maintained so we don’t suggest that approach anymore.</p>
<p>The instructions here have a better workflow and are the current ones linked from the developer pages:</p>

<p>Sorry for the confusion.</p>
