<p>Hi all,<br>
if I measure a length or an angle with Slicer I can read the value only in the 3D view.<br>
Is there any possibility to show it also in the 2D view?</p>
<p>Thanks a lot,<br>
Paolo</p>

<p>In recent Slicer preview releases, you see values in both in slice and 3D views. You can also see them in Markups module (description column).</p>

<p>Thanks <a class="mention" href="/u/lassoan">@lassoan</a>.<br>
Markups module does this, but if I use the ruler on the top bar it has not the same behavior (it doesn’t show the value).<br>
I mean, for me it’s fine, it’s just to highlight this difference.</p>

<p>We’ll remove Annotations module soon. It has many issues and limitations.</p>
