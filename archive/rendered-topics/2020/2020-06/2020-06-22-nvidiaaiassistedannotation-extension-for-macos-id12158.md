<p>Operating system: macOS Catalina version 10.15.5<br>
Slicer version: 4.11.0, revision 29163, built 2020-6-22 (as of <a href="https://download.slicer.org" rel="nofollow noopener">https://download.slicer.org</a>)<br>
Expected behavior: open Extensions Manager and install NvidiaAIAssistedAnnotation<br>
Actual behavior: An error window appears saying “There is no application set to open the URL…” and I cannot see any extensions listed. However I have managed to install an extension from local file downloaded from <a href="http://slicer.kitware.com/midas3/slicerappstore/" rel="nofollow noopener">http://slicer.kitware.com/midas3/slicerappstore/</a>  and I would like to do the same for the NvidiaAIAssistedAnnotation extension, but it only appears available for Windows in that slicerappstore. Any ideas how I can get that extension?</p>
<p>This is the first time I installed and used 3D slicer, so I don’t know if there is any additional step I need to set up that URL and fix the error above.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>
Lorena</p>

<p>I can see it now available in <a href="http://slicer.kitware.com/midas3/slicerappstore" rel="nofollow noopener">http://slicer.kitware.com/midas3/slicerappstore</a> for macOS too and I was able to install it</p>
