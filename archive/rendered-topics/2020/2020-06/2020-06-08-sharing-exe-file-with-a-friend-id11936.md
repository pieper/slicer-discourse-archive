<p>I have built 3D slicer using the source code, now I want to share the built .exe file with a friend so that he could run it on his computer. Would you suggest any way to do this?</p>

<p>To create an installer you need to build the <code>PACKAGE</code> target. You need to have NSIS installed, as described in the <a href="https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/Nightly/Developers/Build_Instructions#Common_Prerequisites_2">building instructions</a>.</p>

<p>Thank you I’ll try.<br>
But I’ll keep bugging you with some more stupid questions.<br>
