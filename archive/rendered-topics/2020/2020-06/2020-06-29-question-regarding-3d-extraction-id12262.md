<p>Hi all,<br>
I recently tried to extract features from a stack of 2D images (which is 3D, e.g. shape (320x320x12)), by setting “voxelbased = True”. I’m confused why the returned value is not a dictionary like the case when I set “voxelbased = False” but like a 3D map? How can I get the dictionary of values instead of the 3D map?<br>
Thanks</p>
