<p>Hello!</p>
<p>We have been working on segmenting the vertebrae semi-automatically. Our algorithm right now includes the user marking fiducial nodes that are used as a source for the flood fill found in the Segment Extra Effects Editor. Does anyone have a complete Python module for a problem like this?</p>
