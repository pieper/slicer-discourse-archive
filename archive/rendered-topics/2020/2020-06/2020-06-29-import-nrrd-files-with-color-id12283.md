<p>I have some nrrd files which contain color. So the typical header looks like this:</p>
<p>dimension: 4<br>
sizes: 3 50 50 47</p>
<p>However i am unable to import the information in slicer. Should i alter the header? Or use some other way to get the color scalars in?</p>

<p>Hmm, I would have thought that would load as a vector volume.  Do you have an example?</p>
