<p>Hello,<br>
i want to use Slicer Morph but it is not appearing either in Version 10.2 or 11.0.<br>
It’s supposed to be above “Wizards”, but I can’t find it.<br>
Does someone know what might be the problem?</p>
<p>Thank you !</p>

<p>SlicerMorph is available both for the current stable and preview version. What is the revision number of the Slicer you are trying to install SlicerMorph (go to Help-&gt;About Slicer, and it should look something like this 4.11.0-2020-09-25 r29389 / 87ca5d3).</p>
