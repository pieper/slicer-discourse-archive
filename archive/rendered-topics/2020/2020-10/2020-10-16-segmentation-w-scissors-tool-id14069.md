<p>Operating system: macOS Catalina 10.15.6<br>
Slicer version: 4.10.2<br>
Expected behavior: Use scissors tool to segment abdominal aorta model into multiple pieces for later printing<br>
Actual behavior: Nothing happens when I use scissors to determine new segment. Im not sure if I am using the wrong settings but can’t seem to segment the model into portions that can then be individually exported as .STL’s</p>

<p>I guess you need to provide bit more details perhaps with screenshot to see what happens and your workflow</p>

<p>Thank you for the quick response. Unfortunately, I will now be out of the lab until Monday. I will be able to screenshot then. Is there anything, in particular, you would need to see?</p>
