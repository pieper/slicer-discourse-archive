<p>Hello everyone, I’m trying to export and open an ultrasound in 3D Slicer from Vinno E35. I’ve worked with some Voluson files (3D cartesian .vol) and it works, as many of you explained in other topics. I ask if someone have worked with this machine could have open the ultrasound in 3DSlider, or you have other suggestions. Many Thanks!</p>
