<p>I am a CT tech who is doing segmentations as a consultant. Does anyone know of companies that use Slicer. I would love to do this full time.</p>

<p>Hi - thanks for posting.  I’m not aware of any specific jobs like that at the moment, but there’s a lot of companies interested in AI for radiology and often accurate ground truth segmentation is the key missing ingredient.</p>
<p>Perhaps you could post some examples of your work in case opportunities arise.</p>

<p>I don’t think it would be appropriate for me to post images of work I have done for the company I work for right now.</p>
<p>If anyone would like to see my work I can send a screenshot.</p>
