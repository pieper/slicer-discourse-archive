<p>Hi Andras,<br>
Is it possibel to rename the module name once created? I created python scripted module? I also need to put it as an extension available for my other colleages to use it? how can I put it on the cloud to be downloaded and installed within 3d slicer like other modules to be used by others?</p>
<p>Thank you</p>
<p>Regards,<br>
Saima Safdar</p>

<p>You can rename a module by replacing the old module name by the new name in all the file names, folder names, and file contents in your source code folder.</p>
