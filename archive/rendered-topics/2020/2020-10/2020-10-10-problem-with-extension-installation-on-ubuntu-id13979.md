<p>Hello. I can not install any extension on my 4.10.2 version on Ubuntu 18.04.05. When I go to the Extension Manager and try to run it, the program switches off. How can I fix it?</p>

<p>Does latest Slicer Stable Release work well?</p>

<p>Thank you for your reply, Mr Lasso. I did not notice that there is a new stable version. I’ve installed it, both the program and extensions work well. Thank you.</p>
