<p>Want to contribute to open-source 3D Slicer and point-of-care ultrasound research without writing code? Please send us a letter of support for our grant NIH proposal!</p>
<p>The proposal is for the renewal of the grant that funds some of the development of open source ultrasound tools for 3D Slicer, PLUS, and ITK. The title of the proposal is “Slicer+PLUS: Collaborative, open-source software for ultrasound analysis.”</p>
<p>In this renewal, we seek to expand the ultrasound analysis capabilities of 3D Slicer to include deep learning methods from MONAI (<a href="https://monai.io/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://monai.io</a>) for tissue characterization.  This grant has three PIs: me, Emad Boctor, and Gabor Fichtinger.</p>
<p>Please email your letters of support to me at</p>
<p><a href="mailto:stephen.aylward@kitware.com">stephen.aylward@kitware.com</a></p>
<p>We need these by midnight on Wednesday, October 28, 2020!</p>
<p>Thanks!<br>
Stephen</p>
<p>PS&gt; Letters of support can be as simple as a text-only email stating your interest in this work or as formal as a description on your letterhead of your related ultrasound work and how it would benefit from improved methods for ultrasound tissue characterization including support for photoacoustic and quantitative ultrasound spectroscopy methods.   Thanks!</p>
