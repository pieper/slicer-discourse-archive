<p>Congratulation on the <a href="https://download.slicer.org/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">new stable release</a> <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>
<p>It would be nice if you update the homepage as well, it is still saying 4.1.2.</p>

<p>This is just an interim release, because we upgrade VTK in the Preview Release, which is expected to break things, and we did not want to let users without a usable recent version. We’ll make formal announcement of the new release soon (as Slicer5).</p>
