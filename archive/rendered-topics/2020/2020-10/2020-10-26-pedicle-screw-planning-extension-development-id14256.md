<p>Hello, this is a thread for anyone who is interested to make some money and also develop a slicer script.</p>
<p>The job involves:</p>
<p>modifying this pedicle screw simulator module extension to a pedicle screw trajectory planner extension.</p>
<p>Essentially instead of screw user should be able to place a cylinder as a trajectory. I understand this can be done simply by changing the screw image file to a cylinder file.</p>
<p>But in Addition user should be able to select the width of that trajectory cylinder and fine tune its placement.</p>
<p>I can further details as needed.</p>
<p>Please contact me with quotes so we may discuss further<br>
Thank you all &lt;3</p>
