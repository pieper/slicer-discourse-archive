<p>Hi, Does the Covariate Significance Testing include any FDR or Multiple Comparison Correction method in its pipeline?<br>
I read carefully the documentation, but found no information about it.<br>
If not, is there any recommendation by SlicerSALT developers?</p>

<p>It turned out that the result is FDR corrected p-value. Does the uncorrected p-values are also saved in somewhere?</p>
