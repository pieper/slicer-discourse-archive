<p>By Kent Leach</p>
<p>Loss of bone volume due to trauma, congenital malformation, or cancer is a significant problem. Tissue engineering is one option to address this need, yet the clinical translation of tissue engineered bone grafts has been modest. More recently, additive manufacturing and 3D bioprinting have emerged as transformative technologies that can speed the clinical translation of tissue engineered products with<br>
the promise of generating functional, patient-specific organs that resemble the complex architecture of human tissues. Bioinks, defined as cell-laden hydrogels with the necessary physicochemical properties<br>
required for biofabrication, are essential for extrusion-based 3D bioprinting. In this project, we performed a comparative analysis of the long-term cell viability and potential of four common bioinks to support the bone-forming potential of human stem cells for the biofabrication of patient-specific bone  grafts.</p>
<p>Dr. Leach focuses on the design of biomaterials and the application of stimuli to regulate cell function to engineer replacement or model tissues. The Leach Lab uses various materials, mechanical stimulation and advanced manufacturing methods to generate platforms with engineered properties that meet the functional and biological demands of native tissue. The team aims to discover new strategies for accelerating the repair and regeneration of lost or diseased tissues and translate these findings to help animal and human patients in need</p>

<p>By Sandra Ritchie</p>
<p>The use of aerosol jet nanoparticle printing to create neural probes for brain-computer interfacing allows our group to overcome the limitations of silicon-based traditional manufacturing techniques. Brain structures are highly three dimensional in nature, with different sections serving vastly different functions. Traditional manufacturing techniques prevent neuroscientists from being able to access and record from the entirety of these 3D structures. By using nanoparticle printing, we have been able to bring the benefits of 3D printing to the world of neuroscience, namely the ability to create complex and fully customizable devices, at the appropriate length-scale.</p>
<p>Sandy Ritchie graduated 2018 with her BS in Mechanical Engineering from Mississippi State University in 2018. After participating in research as an undergraduate student, her interest in advanced manufacturing and 3D printing developed, leading to her current position as a third year PhD student in the Rahul Panat lab at Carnegie Mellon University. Current research interests include 3D printing of biomedical devices, aerosol jet printing, and particle sintering dynamics.</p>

<p>By Marine Traverson</p>
<p>Computer-aided design and manufacturing, and 3- dimensional (3D) printing have increased workflow efficiency and accuracy in human medicine, and find applications in neurologic, orthopedic, maxillofacial and oncologic surgery via the production of pre-surgical visualization models, cutting and drilling guides, and custom-made implants. The use of this technology is nascent in veterinary medicine, and offers the ability to produce individual custom-made biomedical devices and implants to reconstruct complex anatomic defects and restore function in oncologic surgery. This presentation will review a case of canine maxillary osteosarcoma, a large tumor of the snout treated with computer-aided manufacturing.<br>
The design and surgical use of the patient-specific cutting and drilling guide to improve margin cutting accuracy, surgical time, workflow and protection of the surrounding soft tissues will be discussed, as well as the functional and esthetical outcomes obtained with the use of the complementary 3D printed patient-specific maxillary implant.</p>
<p>Dr. Marine Traverson is an Assistant Professor of Soft Tissue and Oncologic Surgery at North Carolina State University College of Veterinary Medicine. She is a Diplomate of the American College of Veterinary Surgeons, and has completed a postdoctoral Fellowship in Surgical Oncology at the University of Florida. Her research focuses on the development of biomedical engineering techniques and interventional organ-sparing approaches for local tumor control in veterinary oncologic surgery, with a particular interest in 3D printing technology and canine osteosarcoma.</p>
