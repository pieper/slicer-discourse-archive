<p>Slicer 4.13 (5c50be61c) with VTK9 (a889f4730) does not show anything in 2D views on Linux. It’s a <a href="https://github.com/Slicer/Slicer/issues/5220" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">known issue</a>. I just wish to know in what delay can we expect a usable 4.13 on Linux ? Thanks.</p>

<p>This is not on just Linux but all operating systems. This is the highest-priority issue right now, and multiple VTK and Slicer developers are working on it. It is a hard problem, but we’ll figure it out for sure, just need more time.</p>
