<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I want to use the basic example module layout to test the functionality of a function I wrote. Essentially, when the foo bar widget is clicked, this function is called and a node should be returned. Any resources on how to approach this?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Thanks, is there an equivalent tutorial that goes as in depth for loadable modules? I couldn’t find any.</p>

<p>Architecture &amp; design concepts are the same for both C++ and Python loadable modules. Syntax difference between Python and C++ is expected to be manageable by C++ developers, but if anything is not clear then let us know here and we can help.</p>
