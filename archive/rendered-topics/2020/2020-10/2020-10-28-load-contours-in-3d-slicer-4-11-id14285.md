<p>Hello everyone,<br>
I’d like to know how I can load contours.<br>
In previous 3D slicer versions I used the following code:</p>
<p>import vtkSlicerContoursModuleMRML<br>
contour = vtkSlicerContoursModuleMRML.vtkMRMLContourNode()</p>
<p>How can I get the same output in 3D slicer 4.11?</p>

<p>Contours module was replaced by Segmentations module about 5 years ago. If you have trouble achieving the same things with Segmentations then let us know what you need exactly.</p>
