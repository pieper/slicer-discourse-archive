<p>How can I manually change image intensity on this version? I’m using an iMac.</p>

<p>If you mean adjusting window/level for better contrast, you can do that through the window/level tool of the mouse modes. See more information at <a href="https://slicer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/user_interface.html#mouse-modes" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://slicer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/user_interface.html#mouse-modes</a></p>
<p>Otherwise you can see a number of filters in SimpleFilters (rescale intensity, intensity windowing) filters to modify the intensity distribution of your image.</p>
