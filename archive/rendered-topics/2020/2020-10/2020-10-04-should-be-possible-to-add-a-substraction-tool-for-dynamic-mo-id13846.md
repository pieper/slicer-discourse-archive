<p>Dynamic Modeler Module is a wonderfull tool to manage models without downgrade surface quality of stl files added to scene. It should be nice to have a substraction tool.<br>
Thanks.</p>

<p>VTK’s built-in Boolean mesh operations do not work well, but we’ll switch to VTK9 very soon and may be able to use VTK Boolean remote module then. Please file a feature request to <a href="http://issues.slicer.org">issues.slicer.org</a>.</p>
