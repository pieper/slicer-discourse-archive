<p>Hi, I’m kicking myself because I bought an iPad and 3DSlicer doesn’t work on it because apparently it’s iOS instead of OS. (I didn’t know that was a thing until I’d already bought it) I was hoping to collect my data on the new computer so I was just wondering, what are the chances you’ll be making Slicer available for that format any time soon?</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

    Hi Hamed, 
It is currently not possible to run 3D Slicer  on an IPad. For now, only devices running Linux or Windows operating systems are supported. 
Regarding the cloud version, there is not yet turn-key solution readily available to run 3D Slicer on the cloud. Based on your specific needs, we could recommend possible approaches. 
Here is an example from <a class="mention" href="/u/lassoan">@lassoan</a> running 3D Slicer on a windows tablet:

<p>If you plan on using 3D Slicer regularly, try returning your iPad and see if you can buy an Mac laptop.</p>
