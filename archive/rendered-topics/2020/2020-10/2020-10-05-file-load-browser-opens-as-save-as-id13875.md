<p>This is happening across a number of modules in the new stable. For example go to screen capture, expand the advanced option and click the “watermark”. Note the dialog box will actually try to overwrite the file you are loading.</p>
<p>Same happens in the Raw Image Guess Input file tab as well.</p>
