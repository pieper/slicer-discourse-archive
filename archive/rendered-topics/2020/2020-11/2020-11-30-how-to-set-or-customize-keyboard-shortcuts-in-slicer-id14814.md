<p>I have some problems about using Slicer. First, how to set or customize keyboard shortcuts in Slicer? This will make slicer more in line with my habits. In addition, I found that when there are many segments in the scene, the display of all view windows is delayed, especially when using tools such as Paint or Draw effect. How to avoid it? I will be appreciate for the help, thanks!</p>

<p>The Slicer application can be controlled a lot with Python scripting. <a href="https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/Nightly/ScriptRepository#Customize_keyboard_shortcuts" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Here is an example for adding keyboard shortcuts</a>.</p>
