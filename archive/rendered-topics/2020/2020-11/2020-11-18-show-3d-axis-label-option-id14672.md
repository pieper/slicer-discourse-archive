<p>“Show 3D axis label” option requires restart in order to take effect, but it doesn’t warn the user about it, like other options that require restarting.</p>
<p>Using the latest stable version 4.11.20200930.</p>

<p>Those are the default view options that are used for initialize new views. For existing views, you can choose to show/hide axis labels using <a href="https://slicer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/user_interface.html#d-view">3D view controllers</a>.</p>

<p>Hmm, it makes sense for us developers, but maybe the user should be informed about that to avoid thinking this option is broken.</p>
<p>Edit:</p>
<p>Ok, reading better, it says “3D viewer defaults”. It’s fair for me.</p>

<p>The fact that you could misunderstand/not notice the labels shows that this panel should be improved. If you have any suggestions for how it could be made more clear then let us know.</p>
