<p>In the CIP module, select the airwayinspector to calculate the relevant parameters. After selecting the location, the calculation result cannot be generated<img src="https://us1.discourse-cdn.com/flex002/uploads/slicer/original/3X/6/b/6be4b93e6ac4ef4d2435c1f48e0c196e03c77a7b.png" alt="%KV2Z2I~{L}R)8M@}LAZV)0" data-base62-sha1="fot7TLgBdNtMYIIMo4hv98xOqIH" width="592" height="485"></p>

<p>Before calculating the parameters, I have extracted the centerline of the airway, and used the CROSS-SECTION in VMTK in version 4.11 to select a plane orthogonal to the centerline. It is precisely because of this that the airway parameters cannot be calculated. Situation, but I don’t know where the problem is. Has anyone encountered this situation before? Can you explain me something?</p>
