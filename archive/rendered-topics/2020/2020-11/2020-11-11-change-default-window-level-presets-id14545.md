<p>Hello!</p>
<p>Is there a way to change the shortcuts allowing to change the Window/Level parameters as they can be found in the <em>Volumes</em> module under <em>Display</em>. On my system (slicer 4.11) they are from left to right: CT-bone, CT-air, PET, CT-abdomen…<br>
If not possible from the GUI or via some parameter file, I guess I could do it programmatically. Could then someone give me some hint on how to implement this (or simply if a one time hack is possible)?</p>
<p>Have a good day!</p>
