<p>The problem I have is that when I try to install the BrainTissueExtension in Extension Wizard, it only recognizes one of the three modules it contains. The problem is that to make use of some of these modules depends on the rest, so, if you want to use it, it does not work because it does not find the rest of modules.<br>
I have noticed, that the only module it recognizes is the one containing a .py file, while the rest of modules do not, because they have .cxx and .h files and I do not know if this could be the problem.</p>
<p>Anyway, I would like to see if someone can help me to be able to install the extension completely.</p>
<p>The gitHub repository: <a href="https://github.com/CSIM-Toolkits/BrainTissuesExtension" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">GitHub - CSIM-Toolkits/BrainTissuesExtension: 3D Slicer extension to segment different brain structures and tissues in MRI structural images.</a></p>
<p>I leave some captures attached:</p>
