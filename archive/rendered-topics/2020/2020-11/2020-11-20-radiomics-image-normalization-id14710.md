<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>I would like to ask about process of doing image normalization for radionics. I have multi sequence MRI brain images. I would like your opinion on should I first normalize the entire image or I should first segment my ROI and then normalize the ROI only. Is there going to be any significant difference between those two approaches and which is considered optimal.</p>
<p>Thanks<br>
Sarv</p>
