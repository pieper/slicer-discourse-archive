<p>I’d really like to see progress bars on long operations; examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Loading a scene and its volumes</li>
<li>Long segmentation operations e.g. grow from seeds</li>
<li>Long operations in extensions (e.g. algorithms that take a while)</li>
</ul>
<p>But especially loading scenes and volumes.</p>
<p>Thanks!!</p>
