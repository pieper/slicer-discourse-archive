<p>Others could be interested in VMTKLab, too. Is it still available/supported/developed?</p>

<p>Hi <a class="mention" href="/u/lassoan">@lassoan</a>, good point.</p>
<p>VMTKLab is available and has a stable set of features. There are no new releases planned at this time but we might resume development phase in the future.</p>
