<p>Dear community</p>
<p>I need to find the voxel used in each CT from my sample to standardize.</p>
<p>To discover kVp, mA/s and slice thickness I have been used the option “dicom metadata” in the option Dicom (DCM). But cant find the information about voxel.</p>
<p>How can find the voxel value?</p>
<p>Tks</p>
