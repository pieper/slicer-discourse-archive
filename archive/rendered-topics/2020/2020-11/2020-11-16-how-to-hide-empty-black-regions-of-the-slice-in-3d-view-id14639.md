<p>Thanks</p>
<p>I wonder if you know a way to remove the black regions visible on the slices in the 3D view?  I would like the view to look like the head was being sliced, but without the black areas.</p>
<p>Thanks again in advance for your help</p>

<p>You can hide black region from the slice view by setting Volumes module / Display section / Threshold (increase the lower limit of the threshold until the border disappears).</p>
