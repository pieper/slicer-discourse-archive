<p>Hello</p>
<p>I am researching to find a way to have a collection of 2d images from a single 3d .stl object in order to use that collection of 2d images for training a machine learning model.</p>
<ul>
<li>first : can i use the 3Dslicer as an API service , which means my app sends the stl image to the service and in return get the result as a collection of 2d images ? ( slices of the 3d object )</li>
<li>even 2d images from different angles would be solution  . ( 20 images from different angles )</li>
</ul>
<p>tnx</p>
