<p>I want to edit the segments on a tablet because I think is easier to use a pen.<br>
or it’s another tool to do it fast.</p>

<p>I’ve been meaning to add this to the documentation for some time…</p>
<p>I use a Wacom Intuos Pro (medium) pen tablet to do all my segmentation work. I program the pen buttons and tablet buttons with shortcut keys, and it speeds up my workflow tremendously.</p>
<p>I mainly use it with a MacBook Pro but I’ve also used it on Windows machines. I highly recommend a drawing tablet if you’re doing lots of manual segmentation work.</p>

<p>Here’s a previous thread which details this type of topic. Surface Pro laptops are used or a Wacom tablet with an Apple laptop</p>

    Hi, 
Are there any recommendations regarding segmentation using stylus/using a tablet. Which device/hardware is best to buy that would work slicer effectively. 
Thanks, 
Sarv

<p>iOS devices (iPad, iPhone) cannot run macOS applications. Apple is trying to converge their software and hardware platforms, so maybe it will be possible in a few years. If you want to use your iPad for segmentation now then maybe you can use it as a sidecar with your Mac, but for better user experience you need connect a pen tablet (Wacom) to your macOS device or use a Windows tablet.</p>

<p>On a related note, is it possible to run Slicer on ARM64? Mainly android tablets?</p>

<p>We explored <a href="https://projectweek.na-mic.org/PW33_2020_GranCanaria/Projects/SlicerOnAndroid/">Slicer on Android</a> a bit - there would be a lot of libraries to port.</p>

<p>OK. Doesn’t sound like a good time investment it is a fairly marginal use case anyways.</p>

<p>Hi<br>
today I made a test with a tablet Lenovo, it works fine I use the tablet as a second screen of my computer. I think easier that way.<br>
You only need to download spacedesk on your computer and also on the tablet or mobile device.</p>

<p>What operating system do you run Slicer on, and what operating system your tablet uses? Do you use the tablet with a stylus?</p>

<p>the way that it works for any tablet is because the app shows the image of the pc or laptop in a table using the IP, the resolution it’s no so good at all because ts transmitting the information in a local web but still works.<br>
you can down load this on the app store for any windows or android I’m not sure if Apple has this application, I think is in the beta version.<br>
and I use windows on my pc I haven’t tested on Linux.<br>
