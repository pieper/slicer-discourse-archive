<p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>I have a completely segmented vessel model and wanted to ask whether I can remove the vessel walls again in order to only see the lumen?</p>
<p>So I could measure the internal dimensions of the segmented vessel exactly and calculate the volume.</p>
<p>Sincerely yours</p>

<p>You can use any of the fill methods (grow from seeds, flood fill, etc.) to fill the volume within the vessel wall.</p>
