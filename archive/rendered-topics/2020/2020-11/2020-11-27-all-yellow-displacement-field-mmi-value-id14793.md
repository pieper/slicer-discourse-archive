<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I’m registering CT and MRI images of pelvis and completely new to Slicer . To get the MMI value, to be able to compare the registrations, I found in other QA that I should see the application log which I assume is the error log but I can’t find any MI value in there. Where exactly should I look for this information?</p>
<p>Another issue I’m having is when I create the displacement field via the convert button in the transform module it gives me all yellow in the slicer views. What’s more, I get the same issue with the Elastix registration result.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>
