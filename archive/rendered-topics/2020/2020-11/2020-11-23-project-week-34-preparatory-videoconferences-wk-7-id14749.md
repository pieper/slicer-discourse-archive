<p>Project Week#34 will be held Dec 14-18, 2020 <strong>on the internet</strong> . Please look here for additional details: <a href="https://projectweek.na-mic.org/PW34_2020_Virtual/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://projectweek.na-mic.org/PW34_2020_Virtual/</a></p>
<p>Due to the COVID 19 pandemic, Project Week 34 will exceptionally take place online. Given this format, the community will be focusing on demos and dissemination of Slicer based projects, which will make this edition a perfect opportunity to introduce new members to the community.</p>
<p><em>Preparation</em> : To prepare, we will be holding weekly meetings at 10am on Tuesdays, starting <strong>October 13, 2020</strong> and ending on December 8. Please join at <a href="https://etsmtl.zoom.us/j/86211702920?pwd=TEl0ZTFDam90WVN5bjZhR05kNVRVZz09" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">this link</a> if you have a project that you would like to present during project week.</p>
<p><em>Background</em> : The Project Week is a week-long hackathon of hands on activity in which medical image computing researchers create solutions using the open source image computing platform, 3D Slicer, and VTK, ITK, CMake, and CDash libraries as well as OHIF, Cornerstone, dcmjs, vtkjs, itkjs, DICOMweb, Girder and related web technologies. Participants work collaboratively on solutions that lie at the interfaces of the fields of computer science, mechanical engineering, biomedical engineering, and medicine. In contrast to conferences and workshops where the primary focus is to report results, the objective of the Project Week is to provide a venue for creators of medical image computing open-source software creators to collaboratively work.</p>
