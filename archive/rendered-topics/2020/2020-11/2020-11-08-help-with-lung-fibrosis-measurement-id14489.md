<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am currently working on measuring lung fibrosis lesions in mice models using µCT, at diferent time-lapses. We are following an approach based on segmenting the fibrotic volume, and then extracting Hounsfield-Units from that region in order to track the status of the lung over time. The work-flow is quite extensive and time-consuming, and also biased in regards of the individual carrying out the whole process.</p>
<p>Is there some method for us to measure fibrotic lesions in a less time-consuming way? We’ve thought of segmenting the whole lung every time we get a new CT acquisition, then measure HU and comparing them with subsequent acquisitions. The problem here is that when the fibrotic volume is quite small or diffuse, the whole lung HUs don’t show differences from a healthy lung.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance,<br>
Dave.</p>
