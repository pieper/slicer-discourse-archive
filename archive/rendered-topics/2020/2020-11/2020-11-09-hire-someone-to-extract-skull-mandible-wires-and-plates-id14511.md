<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have two studies. One of myself pre-surgery, one, post-surgery. I would like to find someone who I can hire to get nice clean extracted models from the data to enable 3D printing a before and after skull. I’m moderately capable in Slicer and have a lot of experience in 3D Printing, but just can’t segment the data well enough to get a clean model out.</p>
<p>Apologies if this is not the right place for this. Looking for pointers on where to get some more professional help with the data modelling/extraction.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Brock</p>

<p>It seems that this message fell through the cracks (probably because it was originally posted in the “Community” category). If you still need help with this then let us know.</p>
