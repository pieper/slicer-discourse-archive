<p>Operating system: windows 64 bit<br>
Slicer version: 4.11.20200930<br>
Expected behavior:<br>
Actual behavior:</p>
<p>Hi!<br>
I have started a new project where I want to measure changes in distal part of mice femur. I want to know  hot to evaluate bone morphometry in slicer 3D, however I have zero experience in this field. Is there any tutorial how to compute bone parameters(BV/TV, TbTh etc.) from scrach?<br>
Is it required to create a 3D model first or is the CT image alone enough? How to properly prepare a image for analysis?<br>
I found tutorial like this, but it doesn’t help me much (as I wrote I have no experience in this kind of analysis.)<br>
file:///C:/Users/ADVentureWS1/Downloads/BoneTextureExtensionTutorial_2017.pdf</p>
<p>I would be very grateful for any help!<br>
Thank you in advance</p>
<p>Iza</p>
