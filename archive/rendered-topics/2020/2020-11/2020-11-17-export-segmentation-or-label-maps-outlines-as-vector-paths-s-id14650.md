<p>Operating system: OS X</p>
<p>Slicer version: 4.11.0</p>
<p>I building a website in which I render segmentations I generated in 3D slicer, and want to manipulate them with html/css (for eg. change the color of a specific segment).<br>
Is there any export format in 3D slicer that would allow me to convert segmentations (or label maps) into vector paths that I can save in an svg file? Or any other structured data format that specifies the points (x,y) that make up the outline for an individual segment?</p>
