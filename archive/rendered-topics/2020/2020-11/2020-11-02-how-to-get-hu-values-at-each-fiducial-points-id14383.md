<p>I would like to know how I can get HU values at multiple fiducial points in the same group.<br>
Ultimately, I’d like to get the HU values of the pixels corresponding to the vertices of the STL model placed in the CT volume data in a tabular format.</p>
<p>I was able to convert each vertex of the STL model to fiducial, as shown in the attached figure.</p>
<p>For these fiducial, is it possible to get the HU value and coordinate values of the pixels in which each of them is located in a table format?</p>
<p>I appriciate all supports from comunity members.</p>
