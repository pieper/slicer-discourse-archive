<p>How can I turn off the magenta rectangular cubic or any added cropped volume? I need to take clean screenshot.</p>

<p>You can hide cropping ROI boxes in Data module.</p>
<p>You can hide the magenta box and axis labels in the <a href="https://slicer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/user_interface.html#d-view">3D view controls</a> - click on the “eye” icon.</p>
