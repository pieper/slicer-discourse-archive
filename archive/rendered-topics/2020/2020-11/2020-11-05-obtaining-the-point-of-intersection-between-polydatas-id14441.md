<p>Hello everyone,<br>
I’d like to know if there is a possibility to obtain points of intersection between two polydata objects. The Class vtkIntersectionPolyDataFilter has only function that returns the number of points of intersection between polydatas. But I’d like to obtain the points of intersection as RAS coordinates.</p>
<p>Best regards,<br>
Anish</p>
