<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am using Slicer 4.11.20200930. I want to use the Segment Comparison module to compute the Dice score of segmentations, which worked fine in older versions of Slicer. However, now I get the following error:<br>
“Error occured during ITK conversion”</p>
<p>Does someone know how to fix this?</p>
<p>Regards,<br>
Janneke</p>
