<p>Hello,<br>
I download a CTSCAN of the lower limb, this images includes femur, tibia, etc. How could i know the mass, height or data of the patient from these files in 3Dslicer?</p>

<p>You can see the metadata in the DICOM database. If you load your CT data via the DICOM module (import DICOM files) and then select the case and right click you will get the option to see metadata.</p>
