<p>Operating system: macOS Sierra v10.12.6<br>
Slicer version: 4.10.2</p>
<p>I need a guided step-by-step tutorial (or python code) on how to save a volume using reformatted axes.<br>
I have reformatted an atlas to match a home-made orientation in several MRIs. Now I need to export it.</p>
<p>I have found similar topics in the Slicer forum but I haven’t been able to export it.</p>
