<p>I’m new to 3DSlicer, so … I have all my medical images on external drives but I am unable to access these drives in the Settings menu. Would appreciate your assistance. Best, Poul</p>

<p>You don’t need to change your settings to access DICOM images on external drives. Just drag-and-drop the folder that contains the DICOM files to Slicer application’s window to import them into Slicer’s DICOM database.</p>
