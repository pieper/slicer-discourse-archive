<p>Hello,</p>
<p>How do I make the 3D view show a model of my segmentation on macOS. When I did the segmentation on my Windows computer it showed up in 3D view automatically, but when I open the files on my mac computer the 3D view just shows the three CT scan perspective (axial, sagittal, coronal) and clicking the button “Show 3D” in the segment editor module does nothing. I can find any drop-down menu to select what appears in the 3D view.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
