<p>Hello everyone, I work for a University and we have been tasked with segmenting out lungs from patient data for a project. We have requested DICOM Data from the hospital (Our Client) and the Data that we have received will not load correctly within 3D Slicer. Every patient data set seems to be coming from a different workstation. Is there a standardized way that we can ask the hospitals to process and format the data before sending it that will make things open up in 3D Slicer more smoothly?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for your help! We hope to get this resolved as soon as possible.</p>
