<p>Hello Dear Developers and Users</p>
<p>How can I access <strong>the scale space particles</strong>?<br>
I found out that this technique is used in SlicerCIP.<br>
Is it possible to get this particle system for the further processing?<br>
On what images is it possible to extract this particle system?</p>
<p>please guide me. In this case, I have no idea how to do it.<br>
Thanks a lot.<br>
Shahrokh</p>
