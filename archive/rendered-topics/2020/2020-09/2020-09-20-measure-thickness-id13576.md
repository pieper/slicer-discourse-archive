<p>Hi, I have previously posted a question about how to measure the thickness (<a href="https://discourse.slicer.org/t/calculate-thickness-of-thin-muscle/13444" class="inline-onebox">Calculate thickness of thin muscle</a>) but did not come to any solution. I have followed this workflow: <a href="https://discourse.slicer.org/t/how-to-analyze-the-thickness-of-the-model/2735/2" class="inline-onebox">How to analyze the thickness of the model - #2 by lassoan</a> and I got the result as in the attached image. It seems like the inner and outer boundary are colored, but where is the medial surface? I need it so that I can measure the thickness (distance between inner and outer boundary) of this segment. After following the workflow, what does the colors indicate?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>
