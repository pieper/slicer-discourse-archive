<p>Hi there<br>
I used 4.10.2 to segment the knee (without patella). I’ve done it after some attempts and fails. All the structures I made using “drawin” and “fill between spaces”. As you can imagine, it took ages to do it. So, my question is, do you have any tips to help me segment it a bit faster?</p>

<p>It would help to share some images what you mean by knee (prox tibia +fibula, distal femur both, muscles or bones etc) and the modality, and show what you specifically want to segment.</p>
<p>Depending on what you want to do, it might be easier and faster to segment just patella, and subtract it from the rest. Would it be  sufficient for your needs?</p>

<p>Thank you for your response.<br>
I want to segment: femur, cartillage, menisci and tibia. My segmentation looks like in the screenshots:<div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://us1.discourse-cdn.com/flex002/uploads/slicer/original/3X/9/c/9c3f58d7bb9a480a2265f94b48f1a7812c8348a7.png" data-download-href="/uploads/short-url/miecL6bXR0NuRXfbaiqaqPcYNAH.png?dl=1" title="Screenshot from 2020-09-11 23-30-26" rel="noopener nofollow ugc"><img src="https://us1.discourse-cdn.com/flex002/uploads/slicer/optimized/3X/9/c/9c3f58d7bb9a480a2265f94b48f1a7812c8348a7_2_690x387.png" alt="Screenshot from 2020-09-11 23-30-26" data-base62-sha1="miecL6bXR0NuRXfbaiqaqPcYNAH" width="690" height="387" srcset="https://us1.discourse-cdn.com/flex002/uploads/slicer/optimized/3X/9/c/9c3f58d7bb9a480a2265f94b48f1a7812c8348a7_2_690x387.png, https://us1.discourse-cdn.com/flex002/uploads/slicer/optimized/3X/9/c/9c3f58d7bb9a480a2265f94b48f1a7812c8348a7_2_1035x580.png 1.5x, https://us1.discourse-cdn.com/flex002/uploads/slicer/original/3X/9/c/9c3f58d7bb9a480a2265f94b48f1a7812c8348a7.png 2x" data-dominant-color="BDBCD2"><div class="meta"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use href="#far-image"></use></svg><span class="filename">Screenshot from 2020-09-11 23-30-26</span><span class="informations">1366×768 189 KB</span><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use href="#discourse-expand"></use></svg></div></a></div></p>
