<p>Hi   As a new user exercise, I am attempting to segment out bone, cardiovasculature and liver in one presentation.  Using the Slicer sample CTACardio data, I can get good segmentation for cv (default artery color) and liver (Nvidia AIAA), but bone discrimination has proven challenging.    What are some good workflows I could try?</p>

<p>It seems that this message fell through the cracks (probably because it was originally posted in the “Community” category instead of “Support”). If you still need help with this then let us know.</p>
