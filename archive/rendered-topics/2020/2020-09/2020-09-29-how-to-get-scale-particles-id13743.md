<p>Hello Dear Developers and Users</p>
<p>In the <strong>Particles</strong> module, which is a subset of the <strong>Chest Imaging Platform</strong> module, I see that the information of particles  must be available as input in the <strong>Input Particles FileName</strong> section.</p>
<p>The question that arises here is that this information (particles) <strong>how</strong> and by <strong>what</strong> the module is produced.</p>
<p>Please guide me. I did not find any document on this subject.</p>
<p>I asked this question in <a href="https://discourse.slicer.org/t/how-to-access-get-to-the-scale-space-particles/13591">3DSlicer Support</a> and  the <a href="https://discourse.slicer.org/t/how-to-access-get-to-the-scale-space-particles-system/13675">Community of 3DSlicer</a>, but unfortunately I do not get any feedback.</p>
<p>Also today I expressed my problems about teem building in <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/teem/mailman/teem-users/?viewmonth=202009" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">teem-users</a>.</p>
<p>Excuse me, perhaps I’m making a mistake and being careless.<br>
Please guide me.</p>
<p>Please guide me.<br>
