<p>Hi all<br>
I’m trying to register CT images with [512,512,48] and diffusion MRI with [128,128,68] dimensions. I am using general registration (BRAINS) modules with the following parameters:</p>
<p>fixed image: CT<br>
Moving image: MRI<br>
percentage of sample: 0.02<br>
linear transform<br>
rigid with 6 DOF</p>
<p>but the registration process encountered some fundamental simple ITK issues and the process did not finish.</p>
<p>I upload all data here:<br>

<p>I would be appreciated for your helps in advance.</p>
