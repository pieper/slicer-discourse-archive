<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>I am very interested in downloading the MacOs version of 3DSlicer. Unfortunately, although i’ve tried multiple links it seems that they are not working. <a href="https://download.slicer.org/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://download.slicer.org/</a> seems to be working but the download links timeout. Any ideas?</p>

<p>Download links work well for me. Please try again and let me know if the problem persists.</p>

<p>Thank you for getting back to me so quickly on this. It seems the links are now working for me also! It must have been a short term issue.</p>
<p>Thanks again.</p>
