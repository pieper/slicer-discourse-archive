<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am looking at texture within a kidney, but removing all cysts to look only at healthy tissue. I was wondering how this would affect GLCM and other features, because there will now be pixels of 0 value within the ROI. I put this final image into pyradiomics to compute features, but I do not want to include the 0th pixels in the computation.</p>

<p>Thank you!</p>
