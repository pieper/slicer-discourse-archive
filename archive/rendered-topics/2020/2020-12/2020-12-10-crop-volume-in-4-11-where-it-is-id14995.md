<p>Operating system: win 10<br>
Slicer version: 4.11.20200930<br>
Expected behavior: it appears like Volume Rendering<br>
Actual behavior: missing crop volume, I search it and use it, but I think there is an easier way, I am to stupid to find it, sorry</p>

<p>Crop volume is in “Converters” category in the module list. I usually hit Ctrl-F, type “Crop” to find the module, then hit Enter.</p>
