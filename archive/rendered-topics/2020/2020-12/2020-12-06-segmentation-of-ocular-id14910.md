<p>Hallo, i am new in 3d slicer. Please help me to teach me how to make ocular segmentation using CT scan of Head ?</p>

<p>There can be many solutions. Please tell a bit more about what you would like to do so that we can guide you to the optimal solution.</p>
<p>What is the clinical application (problem you want to solve)?<br>
What exact anatomical parts would you like to segment?<br>
What are your constraints (time, skills of the user, accuracy)?<br>
How many cases would you like to segment?</p>

<p>I want to do a reconstruction of the ocular in preparation for making the ocular prosthesis.  My reconstruction will be using 3d volume rendering.  I don’t know the step by step in order to produce a good 3D image for later use as an implant.  Plis, help to guide me what steps i have to do in order to produce a 3D volume rendering image ? and in addition to a 3D volume rendering, I want to do a volume measurement.</p>

<p>Can you attach a sample image where you mark what part you would to visualize/quantify?</p>
