<p><em><strong>From the NA-MIC Project Week mailing list</strong></em></p>
<p>Dear members of the Project Week community,</p>
<p>Please register now if you plan on attending Project Week 34 (Dec 14th to 18th).</p>
<p>For those who haven’t attended the preparation meetings, it is still possible to participate as this edition will focus on demos. It is a good opportunity to learn more about recent and future developments in Slicer, extensions you didn’t know existed and related projects that might be useful in your research. The program will be finalized in the following week, but you can already have a good idea by visiting the <a href="https://projectweek.na-mic.org/PW34_2020_Virtual/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">webpage</a>.</p>
<p>Registration is free but required as we will use the information provided to distribute a link to the zoom sessions. To register, simply fill out the following Google Form:</p>
