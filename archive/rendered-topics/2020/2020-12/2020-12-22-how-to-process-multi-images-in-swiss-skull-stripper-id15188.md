<p>Hello!</p>
<p>The extension module ‘swiss skull stripper’ works very well. But I have to process images one by one now. I don’t know how to process multiple 3d images at one time.I guess maybe there’s a faster way.</p>
<p>My dataset is 3d CT images, and my OS is Windows 10.<br>

<p>Swiss Skull Stripper is a CLI module. See how you can run CLI modules from Python console here: <a href="https://slicer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer_guide/python_faq.html#how-to-run-a-cli-module-from-python">https://slicer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer_guide/python_faq.html#how-to-run-a-cli-module-from-python</a></p>
