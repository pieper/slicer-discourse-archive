<p>Operating system: Windows 10<br>
Slicer version: 4.11.2<br>
Expected behavior: I import two models into 3D Slicer. They are the same model but one is rotated and translated by an unknown amount. Since when I import the models into 3D Slicer, as they are placed in a specific translation and rotation compared to the RAS origin and axes, I would assume that I could output this information somehow though 3D slicer but I can’t figure out how.<br>
Actual behavior:</p>
