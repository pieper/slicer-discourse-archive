<p>Dear Project Week participants,</p>
<p>This first online edition of Project Week is soon coming to an end and has far surpassed our expectations. Before we all go back to our respective projects, we would like to know a little bit more about your opinion of this project week to help us organize the next edition which will most likely not be a return to normal. To do so, please fill out the following short survey (max 5 minutes):</p>

<p>Hi <a class="mention" href="/u/rbumm">@rbumm</a> -</p>
<p>No, we decided not to record most of it to encourage spontaneity.  Sorry you couldn’t join, there was a lot of great material and discussions.  Most of the slides are linked from <a href="https://projectweek.na-mic.org/PW34_2020_Virtual/">the main page</a>.  If any topic is particularly interesting to you feel free to follow up here.</p>
<p>Yesterday’s session about African partnerships was recorded but I’m not sure yet where it will be available.  Those presentations were particularly interesting.</p>
<p>We’re planning to have another virtual event in the summer and then, science permitting, in person in Las Palmas next winter, so keep your eyes open for announcements.</p>
