<p>So what if we have groups of segmentations on some volume.</p>
<p>Is there anyway to put them in 1 folder or group them somewhere easily?</p>
<p>I figured out I can place them inside of transformation and apply no changes to transformation and just keep them there for easier managing to ensure they dont get mixed up.</p>

<p>I am a bit puzzled by the question as the title of the topic is the solution. Please use folders in subject hierarchy. Right-click the empty area and you’ll see the option to create one.</p>
