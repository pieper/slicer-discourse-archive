<pre><code>Dear, 
</code></pre>
<p>Do you have an email address where I can send some questions? It keeps getting stuck with me <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>
Thank you very much in advance !!</p>

<pre><code>Perhaps you can also ask some questions via this route. 
</code></pre>
<p>Which file is best to work with to convert it to an STL? my colleague has a samsung accuvix.<br>
She saves the files via cartesian but the problem is that I cannot open these files? Is there a program for this that I can download?<br>
in the slicer I can only open photos and no mvl files? What could be the cause of this? Thank you very much for your time!<br>
mvg Sofie</p>

<p>This topic may help: <a href="https://discourse.slicer.org/t/samsung-sonoace-4d-ultrasound-mvl-file-loading/12452/5" class="inline-onebox">Samsung SonoAce 4D ultrasound mvl file loading</a></p>
<p>If you can share example (anonymized or non-patient) images then we can tell you what is doable with the images that you have.</p>

<p>Ok thanks!</p>
<pre><code>I will definitely see if it works like this. 
</code></pre>
<p>It’s an mvl file but I can’t get it uploaded here?<br>
She also forwarded these files, I don’t know if you like this?<br>
Can you also advise me a program to open these files on my pc? I keep getting an error message. (with an mvl. file)<br>
thank you for your time!<br>
Happy holidays in advance<br>

<p>I can’t find such beautiful images as you in the files? I follow all the steps you take in your video but only get this? Am I doing something wrong? or should I keep looking? <img src="https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"> thank you for your time <img src="https://us1.discourse-cdn.com/flex002/uploads/slicer/original/3X/c/1/c14139eb28ff7231f92e0a0e8507c42b9bd75754.jpeg" alt="slicer" data-base62-sha1="rzBTHnlRmDMvAMEQEK17GwyaBgg" width="640" height="480"></p>

<p>You need to slightly increase/decrease the X, Y, Z dimensions until the rows line up.</p>
