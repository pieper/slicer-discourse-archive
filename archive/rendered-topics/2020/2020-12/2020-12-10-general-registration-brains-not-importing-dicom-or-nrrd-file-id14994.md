<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>I need help registering my ultrasound images. I used the sample data to practice registration, but when I try to do the same with my imported dicom files it wouldn’t allow me to import any of the images. I also exported my dicom files to nrrd and imported it again but when going to the registration tab, it would not let me import any of those files either.</p>
