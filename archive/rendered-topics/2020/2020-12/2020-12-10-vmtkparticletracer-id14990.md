<p>Hello!<br>
I have a problem with the command “vmtkparticletracer”. Putting as input the files (-ifile merge.vtu -sfile source.vtp) I obtain an empty output (traces.vtp). The command line is “vmtkparticletracer -ifile merge.vtu -sfile source.vtp -maximumnumberofsteps 100000 -minspeed 10 -ofile traces.vtp”. It does not provide an error message, but the streamlines in the traces file are not created even if the inputs are correct.<br>
Can you help me?<br>
Thank you in advance!<br>
Sofia</p>

<p>It hard to tell what can go wrong. Maybe if you share your input data set (upload somewhere and post the link here) then somebody can have a look at it.</p>
