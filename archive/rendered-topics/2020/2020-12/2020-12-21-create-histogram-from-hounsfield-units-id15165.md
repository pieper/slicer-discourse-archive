<p>Hi,<br>
I am trying to get a histogram from a segmented region in order to set a threshold for further precise segmentations. I’ve downloaded and installed the extension “SegmentEditorExtraEffects”, but “Threshold local” tool doesn’t show on the Segment Editor display. There are just Draw tube, Fast Matching, Flood filling, Mask Volume, Surface cut and Watershed.<br>
If anybody has an idea why this is going on, I’d appreciate it.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.<br>
David.</p>

<p>Slicer-4.10 is very old, it does not contain Local threshold effect. Install latest Slicer Stable Release to get this feature.</p>
