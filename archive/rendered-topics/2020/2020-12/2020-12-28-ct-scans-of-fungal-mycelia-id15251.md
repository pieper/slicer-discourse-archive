<p>Looking for free data sets of fungal mycelia to explore 3D modeling and tangible 3D printing</p>

<p>Majority of users on this forum work with clinical and pre-clinical (animal) images. There are of course biologists, geologists, astronomers, etc. who analyze their images using 3D Slicer, but I’m not sure if you will find anyone here that can share fungal mycelia images. I would suggest to contact research groups who have published papers in this area and ask them if they can share images with you.</p>
