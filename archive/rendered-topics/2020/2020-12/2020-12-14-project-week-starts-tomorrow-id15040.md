<p><strong>Very Important:</strong> Please make sure to update the Zoom software installed on your computer to the latest version available before Monday as only this latest version will allow you to freely move between the different breakout rooms.</p>
<p>The zoom session will be open 1 hour before the start of the meeting (at 11am EST) so that you can test your connection and informally socialize in breakout rooms.</p>
<p><strong>How to navigate this virtual project week?</strong> The short answer is: connect to Zoom before 12pm EDT on Monday and we’ll tell you everything about it.</p>
<p>In the meantime, you can check out the program on the <a href="https://projectweek.na-mic.org/PW34_2020_Virtual/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">webpage</a>. Please note: the Google Calendar embedded in the page contains links to the detailed schedule of each session.</p>
<p>Looking forward to seeing you all on Monday!</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>
