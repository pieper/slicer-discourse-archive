<p>Modules with .bat/.m/.xml are implemented in Matlab. In general they should be straightforward to port to Python. If you have any specific questions then let us know.</p>

<p>Yeah, it’s okay i solve all of my problems, the problem was that i used one version for development and it wasn’t support extension manager. Now I fixed it by downloading a new one, and now it works with all my modules. Thanks a lot !</p>
