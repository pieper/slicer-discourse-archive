<p>Dear 3DSlicer-Community,<br>
I am facing a Problem right now and could not find a solution for that here yet.<br>
I want to create different Segmentations of the same part (here a vertebra) but one, showing the whole vertebra, the other only the cancellous bone and onther one only the cortical shell. Whenever I change for example the Threshold in one of the segmentation it is changed also in the other ones. How can I do the segmentation independantely from the setup of the other?<br>
Thanks a lot in advance!<br>
Best wishes</p>
