<p>I haven’t been able to figure out a way in the GUI yet to jump to a LineNode object where both end points are visible in the same view.  When the line node is drawn across axis in 3D space or you’ve reformatted views after placement it becomes difficult to be able to see the line node again with both points in the same view.  A reason for having both endpoints in the same view seems to be that this is the only way to select the object for translating the entire object.</p>
<p>AngleNode and PlaneNode might also be instances where you’ve reformatted views or placed in 3D and you want an option to quickly snap a slice view to the plane generated by the markups of that object.</p>
