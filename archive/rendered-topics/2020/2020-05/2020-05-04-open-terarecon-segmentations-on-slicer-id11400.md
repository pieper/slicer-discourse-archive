<p>Hi! Does anyone of you know if it’s somehow possible to open a segmentation from TeraRecon on slicer? It seems that I can only open the original .dcm-scan and that I have to redo the segmentation work on slicer which is really frustrating…<br>
It would be awesome if someone could help!</p>

<p>If TeraRecon uses any standard format (DICOM Segmentation Object, RT structure set, or various research formats) then Slicer can import those. Can you provide a complete example data set? For example, download a sample image from <a href="https://www.cancerimagingarchive.net/">TCIA</a>, segment it, upload it to dropbox/onedrive/gdrive, and post the link here.</p>
