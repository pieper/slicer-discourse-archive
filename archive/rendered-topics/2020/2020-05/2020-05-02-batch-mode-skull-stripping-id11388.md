<p>All features of Slicer is available in Python and can be applied in batch processing workflows.</p>
<p>SwissSkullStripper module is a “CLI module” which can be run in Python as described <a href="https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/Nightly/Developers/Python_scripting#Running_a_CLI_from_Python">here</a>.</p>
