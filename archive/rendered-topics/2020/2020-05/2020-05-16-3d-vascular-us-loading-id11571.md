<p>There is any way to load 3D vascular US (I can’t export in cartesian Dicom) in slicer? Please give me a clue</p>

<p>You can find detailed description of what 3D US can Slicer import here: <a href="https://github.com/SlicerHeart/SlicerHeart#importing-dicom-files">https://github.com/SlicerHeart/SlicerHeart#importing-dicom-files</a></p>
<p>If you can get an open specification of the file format from the vendor (without any strings attached) then we can implement an importer for that in Slicer.</p>
