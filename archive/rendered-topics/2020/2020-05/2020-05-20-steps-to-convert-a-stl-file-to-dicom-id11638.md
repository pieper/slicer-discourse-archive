<p>Hi, I am very new in with this software. I would like to have a 3D model of an implant converted into dicom CT series. As I understood, it cannot be converted directly to dicom since it is not a solid object it is a surface mesh structure of the object. So what can I do to reach my goal? Whats steps are neccessary to transform a stl to dicom? unfortunately I have no idea and I could also not find any hints online.</p>
