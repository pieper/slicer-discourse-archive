<p>Hi! I have a problem with the plugin Robust Statistic Segmentation.<br>
It crashes when i launch it with a previously saved segmentation,<br>
it works quite well if I use a segmentation it is done in a single session.<br>
I am using 3DSlicer version 4.10.2 r28257 in Windows 7 64Bit</p>
<p>thanks to those who can help me<br>
