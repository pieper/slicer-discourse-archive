<p>What do you mean by dose mapping?</p>
<p>How did you end up with having png images that contain CT and dose?  Normally you would save images in DICOM or standard 3D image formats (nrrd, mha, …).</p>

<p>I got screenshots of images having both CT and dose in png. Now can I convert into Dicom back?<br>
Or can i convert it by exported nrrd file  back to dicom?<br>
One more question - how can i export dicom ct slices + corresponding dicom dose  file into file integrated dicom  so that i can export into nrrd file format?</p>
