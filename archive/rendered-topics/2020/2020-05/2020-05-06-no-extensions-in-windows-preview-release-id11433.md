<p>I just downloaded the Windows preview version 29049 and there are no extensions showing up in the extension manager. I checked cdash and see Linux and Mac builds for our extension but no Windows. It doesn’t look like there’s anything building now, will they be built later?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>I just restarted the windows extension build, they should start coming up in the extension manager as they finish.</p>
