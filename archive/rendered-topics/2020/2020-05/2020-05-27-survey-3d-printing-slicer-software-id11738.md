<p>Hello 3D-print enthusiasts,</p>
<p>We would like to know about your experiences with 3D-printing parameters in your current Slicer. It would be very helpful if you completed this survey. The survey is for educational purposes and completely anonymous.</p>

<p>Thanks for reaching out</p>
<p>While 3D Slicer is used in the context of 3D printing. See <a href="https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/Nightly/Training#Segmentation_for_3D_printing">https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/Nightly/Training#Segmentation_for_3D_printing</a></p>
<p>Based on the survey questions, it looks like you are interested in  <code>Slic3r</code> and not <code>3D Slicer</code>. These are two different software.</p>
