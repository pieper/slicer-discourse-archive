<p>Since 4.11.0-2020-05-06 r29052 / 865dd83, the 2D views are not synchronized with shift+mouse on a VolumeRendering 3D view. This was OK with 4.11.0-2020-04-30 r29028 / 1956d89.</p>
<p>The 2D views do get synchronized with shift+mouse on a 2D view however.</p>
<p>Thank you for looking into this.</p>
<p>Regards.</p>
