<p>Hi;<br>
Is it possible to create many segments in slicer and export them as DICOM RTSS. I know how can I export one segment as Dicom RTSS in order to display it as planar contours (<a href="https://discourse.slicer.org/t/create-a-set-of-planar-contours-from-irm-images/10084/3" class="inline-onebox">Create a set of planar contours from IRM images</a>), but what about If I segment more than one structure in slicer?</p>
<p>Thank’s in advance</p>

<p>The process is the same, whether you have one segment or a dozen in the segmentation. Which step do you have trouble with?</p>
