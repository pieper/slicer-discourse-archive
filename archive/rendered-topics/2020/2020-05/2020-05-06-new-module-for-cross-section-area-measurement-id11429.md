<p>We have added a new module for measuring 2D cross-section area of segmented structures. User can choose measurement axis direction and results are available both as table and plot.</p>

<p>It is available for latest Slicer Preview Release (Slicer-4.11) in Sandbox extension (in Examples category). After the extension is installed, the “Segment Cross-Section Area” module will show up in Quantification category.</p>
<p>Thanks for <a class="mention" href="/u/hherhold">@hherhold</a> for developing the original version of the module.</p>
<p>Any comments and suggestions are welcome.</p>

<p>Hi Andras,</p>
<p>Thanks for polishing this up and making it a real module. I learned a lot from doing the original, and even more from reading through your version. Looks awesome.</p>
<p>Thanks again!</p>

<p>The 3D slicer community is sooo warm!<br>
I am finding the way to calculate the 2D segment area and the new version 3D slicer with the new module is releasing! How lucky!<br>
Thank you sooo much!</p>

<p>Hi Hollister,<br>
Thank you so much for the module.<br>
I want to use this modle in a stable version 3D Slicer 4.10, but I don’t know how to install/run it. Would you mind to teach me?</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>
Jue</p>

<p>If you want to use this module then you must upgrade to a recent Slicer Preview Release.</p>
<p>Preview Releases work well, they do not have any known issues. However, if you switch to Slicer-4.11 then it is recommended to keep using that and not try to load scenes that are crates with Slicer-4.11 into Slicer-4.10.</p>
