<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Kindly, how can I display the whole view for DICOM images which were been taken in an oblique position ?</p>
<p>I have an images for the pancreas which were acquired in an oblique slices, and after I uploaded these images into the slicer, parts of the images are disappeared ? and if I would like to segment the pancreas in these images and then eras some parts of the segmented pancreas in a certain slice, the up and the down slices were been also erased.</p>
<p>Thanks all</p>
