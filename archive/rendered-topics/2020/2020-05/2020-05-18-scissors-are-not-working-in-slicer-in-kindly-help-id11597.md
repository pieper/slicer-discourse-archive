<p>Operating system:windows<br>
Slicer version:4.10.2 and 4.11 preview</p>
<p>sequence of steps<br>
loaded sample CTChest<br>
opened module segment editor<br>
created two segments<br>
created a mask by using threshold to seperate out the airways and lungs<br>
generated a 3d model using grow from seeds<br>
used segment statstics to generate volume of lung with airway<br>
tried to use scissors to cut out the lung lobes so that only the airway remains behind , but the scissors wouldnt work<br>
