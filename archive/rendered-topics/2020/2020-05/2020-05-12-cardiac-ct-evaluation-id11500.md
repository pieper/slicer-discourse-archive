<p>Operating system:<br>
Slicer version:<br>
Expected behavior:<br>
Actual behavior:<br>
I have 15 dog cardiac CT scans of the full cardiac cycle. Some of them has motion artifacts but there should be an evaluation made for the left AV opening and coronary vessel length etc. I choosed the phase I wanted, reformated the scans, etc. My question is: is there someone who has experience in cardiac evalutions for cardiac vessels, openings etc? These are not easy scans since it is not human size, high cardiac frequencies but the measurements should be somehow standardized.</p>
