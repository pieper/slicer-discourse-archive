<h2>New “good first issue” label</h2>
<p>To help identify issues relevant for new contributors, we just  added the <a href="https://github.com/Slicer/Slicer/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22">good first issue</a> label to the issue tracker.</p>
<h2>What is the a “good first issue” ?</h2>
<p>There are no single way to answer this question.</p>
<p>Such an issue could be defined as <em>an issue that does not require an understanding of the overall architecture</em>.</p>
<p>That said, even that attempt to a definition is quite general and unclear.</p>
<p>The bottom line is to be welcoming, patient and supportive of new contributors by spending some time guiding them.</p>
