<p>Hi,<br>
I am trying to reconstruct a heart model from MRI scans.<br>
There are only about 10 slices (short-axis view), so the LV resolution is very coarse.<br>
I used the Segmentation Editor to create a 3d model (pics are attached). However, the geometry is inaccurate and there are many holes, within each slice and in between slices.<br>
The interpolation feature is not ideal due to the large distance between the contours.</p>
<p>I would appreciate your help.</p>
