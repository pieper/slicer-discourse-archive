<p>I get two different timepoints data of a patient,  and the two data’s thickness is different. Is there a way to specify the matching relationship between layers? When I scroll one view, another view scrolls together following the matching relationship.</p>

<p>Yes, that’s they way it works by default.  Select the different volumes in different slice views, set them to have the same orientation (e.g. axial) and then click the link button (or hot link them).</p>
