<p>Operating system:mac<br>
Slicer version:4.10.2<br>
Expected behavior: After segmentation the radiomic feature extraction is taking unusually long… sometimes even 32 hours for a single study .<br>
Actual behavior: In the past it took less than 20 mins for the same for similar study .</p>

<p>I’m having the same issue. It doesn’t seem that the CPU is working hard at all.</p>
