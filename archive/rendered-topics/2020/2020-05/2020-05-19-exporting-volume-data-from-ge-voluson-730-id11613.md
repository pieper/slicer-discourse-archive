<p>Hello all,</p>
<p>I’d like to preface that I’m a software architect but have no knowledge/experience with bio-medical devices.</p>
<p>What I’m trying to do ultimately, is 3D print an ultrasound of my baby (wife is 7 months pregnant).  My understanding is that the technician needs to export the volume files which I’ll then be able to load in a software (I found a few) that will allow me to clean up the image.  From then I can then convert it to STL files that the 3D printer requires.</p>
<p>My issue is that the technician didn’t seem to know how to export the scan’s volume file.  How would we go about doing that on a GE Voluson 730 machine?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.  I really hope we can figure this out. It’d be so cool to 3D print what my daughter looks like right now!</p>

<p>I also want to export the 3d file. But I think it can export raw volume data and stl-like file.I want raw volume data , and I want to know how to read it in WINDOWS</p>
