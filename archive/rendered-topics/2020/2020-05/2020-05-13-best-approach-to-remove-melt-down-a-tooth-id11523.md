<p>Hello. What is a good approach to remove a tooth from a teeth from a CBCT ?</p>
<p>I have read these docs: <a href="https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/Nightly/Training#Segmentation" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Documentation/Nightly/Training - Slicer Wiki</a></p>
<p>in order to see a growing from seeds approach, and I have tried this technique in 3d slicer. My trial doesn’t output a good result, (of course, I have little experience on 3d slicer) I mean I cut a piece of tooth, but the cutting is not quite only a tooth … if you know what I mean.</p>
<p>But I need a kind of scissor to cut down, to extract, to melt down a single tooth from a teeth:</p>

<p>If I could anonymize the dicom series, I would upload here for trial. I’ll try that. I hope you can find a little time to write me a hint, anything that could help me.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
