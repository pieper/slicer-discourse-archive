<p>Dear all<br>
Is there an extension that allows to extract segment statistics for known CT calibration parameters?<br>
I would like to extract bone density values instead of HU.<br>
Thanks</p>

<p>Segment statistics reports results in whatever unit your image contains. If you have a calibration formula then you can easily transform your voxel values according to that, before you compute statistics.</p>

<p>Dr Lasso<br>
Can I ask how the voxel values can be transformed in slicer?<br>
Since I would like to use different formulae, is it possible to apply the different transformations for different voxel values intervals?<br>
Thank you so much for your quick reply.</p>

<p>Yes, you can transform the values any way you want by getting voxel array as a numpy array and then use standard Python functions on that array. See <a href="https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/Nightly/ScriptRepository#Add_noise_to_image">examples in the script repository</a>.</p>
