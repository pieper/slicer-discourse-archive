<p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>I am new to the slicer 3d and would like to map brain lesions (structural scans, T1, DWI, T2, dicom format) to visualize interactions with fibre tracts by coregistration with a standard connectome database/atlas (like HCP). As far as I understand, the workflow should be:</p>
<ol>
<li>Coregister individual MRI data with MNI-standard space</li>
<li>Delineate lesions</li>
<li>Coregister with the connectome tracts.</li>
</ol>
<p>Is this possible? If yes- would someone mind helping me navigate through the steps?</p>
<p>Many thanks,<br>
M</p>
