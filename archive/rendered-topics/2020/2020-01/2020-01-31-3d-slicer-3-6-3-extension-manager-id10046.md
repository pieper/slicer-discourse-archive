<p>Hello all, is the 3D Slicer 3.6.3 version still supported? If so, where can I download the extension manager tools?</p>
<p>When trying to open the extension manager windows (<a href="http://ext.slicer.org/ext/Slicer-3-6/16156-win32" rel="nofollow noopener">http://ext.slicer.org/ext/Slicer-3-6/16156-win32</a>) the error message appears: “Could not connect to specified repository, check network connection.” Is this web page still alive? Is there a way how to still open the extension manager in 3D Slicer 3.6.3.?</p>
<p>Thanks a lot<br>
Regards<br>
Adam</p>

<p>It is not recommend to use the win32 version slicer now because of the lower computer ability. Why not change to the new version?</p>

<p>OK. I see the best is to upgrade my Slicer version up to date.</p>
