<p>Hello guys,</p>
<p>I am trying to access the metadata of a loaded CT in an extension that I am writing in Python.<br>
For example i would like to the number of colums, rows and slices and the voxel sizes.<br>
How can I access this data?</p>
<p>Thanks a lot!</p>

<p>Have a look at <a href="https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/Nightly/ScriptRepository#DICOM_2">DICOM examples in the script repository</a> and let us know if you still have questions.</p>
