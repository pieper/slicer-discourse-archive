<p>(This job is posted here by suggestion of someone in the MEDPHYS &amp; Slicer communities.)</p>
<p>The Surgical Mechatronics Laboratory (SML) is a part of the Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University, and conducts research in robotics for surgical and other biomedical applications, with a focus on systems with minimal obtrusiveness with regard to clinical workflow.  The SML has active collaborations with surgeons and other clinicians from the University of Pittsburgh, Johns Hopkins University, and Allegheny General Hospital.</p>
<p>Job description:<br>
The SML has an immediate opening for a postdoctoral fellow with an annual contract.  You will be directly responsible for numerous aspects of design and magnetic modeling of an electromagnetic tracker system for handheld surgical robotics.  A particular concern is developing understanding of how eddy current and ferromagnetic effects of metal objects disturb the measurement, and exploring methods for compensation.  This is an open hardware project; see <a href="https://github.com/robmacl/ilemt_hw/wiki" rel="nofollow noopener">https://github.com/robmacl/ilemt_hw/wiki</a> for additional information.  You will collaborate with a team of graduate and undergraduate students, research staff, and clinicians, and will also be involved in various aspects of the Micron project, which deals with handheld robotic systems for accuracy enhancement in ophthalmic microsurgery and microneurosurgery.</p>
<p>Qualifications:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ph.D. in physics or engineering</li>
<li>Strong grasp of magnetics, and experience with finite element magnetic modeling.</li>
<li>Electronics skills are a plus</li>
</ul>
<p>This position is available immediately.  Interested candidates should send a single PDF file including a CV, list of references, and relevant publications to Prof. Cameron Riviere (camr@ri.cmu.edu).</p>
