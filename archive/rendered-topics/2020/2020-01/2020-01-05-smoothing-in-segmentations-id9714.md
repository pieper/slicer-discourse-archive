<p>I am not seeing a control for smoothing when exporting a segmentation to a model in the segmentations module. Does that mean the smoothing parameter is controlled solely from the 3D model button of the segment editor (because that seems to have an effect in the resultant model).</p>

<p>Yes, what is exported is what you see.</p>
