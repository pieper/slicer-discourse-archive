<p>Is there a way to calculate IVIM f, D, D* in Slicer from DWI DICOMs?<br>
I read some papers mentioning they used Slicer but I cannot find any clue.</p>

<p>As far as I know those are still research codes and haven’t made it into SlicerDMRI yet.  Best to contact the paper authors directly to find the status.</p>
