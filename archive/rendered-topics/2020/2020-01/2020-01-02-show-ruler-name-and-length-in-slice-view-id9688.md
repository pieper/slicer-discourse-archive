<p>If I do not remember incorrectly, it was possible before to see the ruler name and length in the slice view. Now I can only see it in the 3D view. How can I get the slice view to show the ruler name and length?</p>
<p>Using the latest Slicer preview version on Linux.</p>
<p>Best regards,<br>

<p>You can display labels at markup line endpoints.</p>
<p>Currently, node label and length are not displayed in slice views but we plan to add these soon.</p>
