<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I tried making surface ssm with tibias. To apply this methods, I align all models before using SPHARM(picture on right).</p>
<p>However, while SPHARM module is running, the alignments were changed.<br>
(the picture on the left is result of SPHARM module’s doing alignment)<br>
I tried to run with using registration templetes but the results were same.</p>
<p>So, I want to know if it can do SPHARM mesh generation without doing align again(suppose the models are all aligned already like picture on the right)</p>
<p>Thank you for read this question.</p>
<p>Regards,<br>
Jeongseok</p>
