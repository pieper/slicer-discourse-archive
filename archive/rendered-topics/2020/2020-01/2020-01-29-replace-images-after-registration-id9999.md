<p>Hi–</p>
<p>Is it possible to replace my already registered grayscale histology image with the exact same image but coloured without having to redo fiducials and registration again?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Yes, you can apply any transform to any volumes. If you run into any issues then let us know.</p>
