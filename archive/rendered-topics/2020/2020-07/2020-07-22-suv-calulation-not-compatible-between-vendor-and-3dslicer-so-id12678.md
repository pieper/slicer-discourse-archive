<p>HelloSlicer community,<br>
i have a problem with suv calculation which seems not wrong between a vendor one and slicer.<br>
Operating system:Window<br>
Slicer version: 4.10.2<br>
Expected behavior:The suvbw calculation do no correspond to ISP philips or hand calculation by more than 10%. The SUV should be around 1. I measure around 0.98 with ISP and 0.87 with 3d slicer<br>
Actual behavior:<br>
Here a link to the image.<br>
