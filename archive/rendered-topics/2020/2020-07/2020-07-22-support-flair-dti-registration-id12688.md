<p>Dear Sirs</p>
<p>I am a 3DSLICER user and I am using the General Registration (BRAINS) module to register flair and dti images. I follow the 3dslicer manual to register the images but the registration is not good. Especially in the anterior periventricular region, it is not well registered. I would like to know if there is any configuration or other module to obtain a good record between flair and dti.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>As you probably know, there can be distortion in dti that’s hard to account for.  In any case you can try SlicerElastix and also consult the use case library for ideas.</p>
