<p>I would like to give special thanks to Csaba Pinter(<a class="mention" href="/u/cpinter">@cpinter</a>) and Kyle Sunderland(<span class="mention">@Sunderlankyl</span>) for the help as well as Li Zhenzu(<a class="mention" href="/u/timeanddoctor">@timeanddoctor</a>) for the educated reasoning. And more than anyone else on this entire platform, the man who runs it all, I would like to take a moment to thank <a class="mention" href="/u/vertebrae">@vertebrae</a>.</p>
<p>Some of my highlights were receiving new user of the month and being promoted to trust level member.</p>
<p>Thank you all!</p>

<p>Yes. Is there any way we can keep you active within the slicer community? It would be a shame to lose you.</p>
