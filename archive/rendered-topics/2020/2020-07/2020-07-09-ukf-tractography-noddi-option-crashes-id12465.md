<p>Operating system: MAC OS<br>
Slicer version: 4.11<br>
Expected behavior: UKF Tractography NODDI<br>
Actual behavior: UKF Tractography NODDI crashes</p>
<p>This UKF tractography NODDI option crashes for MAC OS but this same option with same data works perfectly on linux.  The UKF tractography works fine for both MACOS and linux as the 2-tensor model.  Its only the NODDI option that crashes.  Can you please fix it?</p>

<p>Probably best to engage with the developers here: <a href="https://github.com/pnlbwh/ukftractography/issues">https://github.com/pnlbwh/ukftractography/issues</a></p>
