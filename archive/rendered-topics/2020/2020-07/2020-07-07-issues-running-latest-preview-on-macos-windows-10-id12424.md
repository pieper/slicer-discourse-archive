<p>I tried downloading the newest preview today (rev: 29205) on both Windows and macOS and it doesn’t seem to be running.</p>
<p>On Windows the splash shows up, things look like they load and I get the GUI box, but then it all crashes and I see no error.</p>
<p>On macOS, the GUI window loads visually, but then the app stops responding and crashes…</p>
<p>Is there any way to get the previous revision/build for the Preview?</p>

<p>Sure, you can access previous releases by specifying a date or number of days to go back. See details <a href="https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/Nightly/FAQ/General#Where_can_I_download_Slicer.3F">here</a>.</p>
<p>Good news: I can reproduce the problem, so it will be fixed by tomorrow.</p>

<p>Thanks for reporting this, you just need wait a few more hours for the new nightly build to complete or use Slicer from the day before yesterday.</p>
