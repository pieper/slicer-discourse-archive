<p>I am using 3DSlicer 4.10.2. I want to calculate ICE and Jacobian with this tool, but I cannot do it like “SlicerRegistrationQA”. I do not know the cause.<br>
Please tell me more detailed materials such as downloading RegQA module and obtaining values.</p>

<p>I am using 3D Slicer 4.10.2.<br>
I read “Slicer Registration QA”, but I don’t know how to download the module for calculating ICE and Jacobian.<br>
How can I download it?</p>
