<p>Sounds good - I’d also like to touch base on using custom Terminologies with the Segment Editor and in particular how we want to handle modifiers.  For context, we’ll be doing a whole set of segmentations of lymph nodes from CT and we’ll want to be able to encode, for example, left axillary lymph node, or confluent mediastinal lymph nodes.  I’d like help making this convenient for the radiologist doing the annotations so we can export them as DICOM SEG.</p>

<p>I’m working on updating mpReview module to use Segment Editor and custom terminologies (see <a href="https://github.com/lassoan/mpReview/blob/master/mpReview.py">here</a>). It is not ready yet but you can take a few ideas from there.</p>
<p>We are also starting to use custom terminology files for SlicerHeart (to include specific snomed CT terms for leaflets, etc. - small details that are not included in the default terminology files bundled with Slicer).</p>
