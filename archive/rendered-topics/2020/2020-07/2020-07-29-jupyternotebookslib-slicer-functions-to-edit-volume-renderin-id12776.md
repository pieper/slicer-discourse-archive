<p>Hi, I am able to successfully load a volume into the SlicerWeb extension and use the JupyterNotebookLib. What I wanted to do now is use functions in this library that enable me to change the volume rendering presets and opacity/color mapping in real-time and present them to the user as a changeable parameter just like ipywidgets is used to for instance interact with the 3D positioning of the volume. Are there functions like this built-in?</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>
