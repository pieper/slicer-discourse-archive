<p>I am using python for my module and I am exporting my label map to a segmentation.<br>
The names of the segments seem to get numbers but I want them to have names after the import. Is that possible?</p>
<p>slicer.modules.segmentations.logic().ImportLabelmapToSegmentationNode(myLabelMapNode, newSegmentationNode)</p>
